        <h2 class="left">Positive Coaching</h2>
        <p>NCLL is a double-goal league, which means its managers and coaches are trained yearly by the Positive Coaching Alliance (PCA). PCA promotes an approach to youth sports that focuses on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing the whole athlete</li>
            <li>Using sports to teach life lessons</li>
            <li>Supporting coaches and parents to think beyond wins and losses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Several organizations offer valuable resources on coaching the whole person, inspiring risk-taking, and encouraging a growth mindset in players. One example is <a href="http://www.positivesportcoaching.org/" class="ncll">Positive Coaching Alliance</a> who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides resources for coaches, parents, and athletes</li>
            <li>Offers weekly email reminders during the season</li>
            <li>Includes videos, research, and information to guide coaching practice in all sports</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span>Why have a pre-season parent meeting?</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>People tend to live up to expectations if they know them.</li>

        <p><span>When and where to have the meeting:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The most effective way to have your pre-season parent meeting is in a private setting where you can have the full attention of the group.</li>
            <li>If this is not possible, the meeting could be scheduled before one of the first practices or games when the parents would need to be delivering their kids anyway.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span>What to cover in the meeting:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Introductions:</span> Introduce yourself and any other coaches or team officials.</li>
            <li><span>Team goals:</span> Discuss the team's goals for the season, both on and off the field.</li>
            <li><span>Expectations:</span> Outline your expectations for the players and parents, including behavior, attendance, and communication.</li>
            <li><span>Schedule:</span> Review the team's practice and game schedule.</li>
            <li><span>Communication:</span> Discuss how you will communicate with parents throughout the season.</li>
            <li><span>Questions and answers:</span> Allow time for parents to ask questions and share their concerns.</li>
