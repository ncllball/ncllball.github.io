    <!-- Parent Helpers Section -->
    <section id="parent-helpers">
        <h2 id="parent-helpers" class="left">Parent Helpers</h2>
        <p>Our coaches are volunteers, just like you. Managing a team of 12 kids on the field can be challenging for one or
            two adults. Parent Helpers can assist with drills, transitions, and ball retrieval. As the season progresses,
            some parents may transition to assisting with drills.</p>
        <p>The more adults on the field, the more active and engaging the environment is for the kids. This leads to faster
            skill development and a more enjoyable experience for all.</p>
        <p><span>Volunteer registration is required for any activity.</span></p>
