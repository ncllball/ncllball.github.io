    <title>NCLL Coaching Overview</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2 id="managers-and-coaches" class="left">Managers and Coaches</h2>
        <p>NCLL relies heavily on its managers and coaches. This section provides an overview of the information and
            resources available to them. Despite the perception that coaching baseball or softball requires prior
            experience, many coaches in our older divisions (AAA &amp; Major) began their coaching journey at the Tee-Ball
            level with <em>no prior experience</em>.</p>
        <p>There is a discrepancy between the LLI nomenclature and what resonates with our families, particularly between
            'Team Manager' and 'Head Coach'. Using 'Team Manager' for a head coach confuses families and diminishes the role
            our parents understand as 'Team Manager' (team parent role). Therefore, for 2025, we've updated the terms to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Head Coach</li>
            <li>Assistant Coach</li>
            <li>Team Manager</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I wanted to clarify these terms to avoid confusion for those accustomed to the previous terminology. For 2025,
            these are the terms NCLL will be using.</p>

            <p>NCLL is a Positive Coaching league. All managers must attend a seminar from the Positive Coaching Alliance (PCA) and uphold the rules of conduct set forth by NCLL and PCA.

            <ul>
                <li>New managers should indicate their interest in leading a team during the registration process. Teams will be formed around the manager and their child, taking into account placement requests as much as possible.</li>
                <li>Returning managers should also indicate their interest in managing. All efforts will be made to keep players and teams together from previous years at the AA level and below. Players returning from the previous season should register before the deadline to guarantee a spot on the same team. Assistant coaches can request teams at AA and below.</li>
                <li>At the AAA level and above, teams are formed using a draft system. This is done to achieve parity, a requirement of Little League International. All players interested in playing at these levels will participate in a formal assessment.
