            Interleague refers to games played against teams from neighboring little leagues such as Ballard, Magnolia,

    <section>
        <h2 class="left">Why Play Up in <em>Summerball25</em>?</h2>
        <p>
            We encourage kids to move up a division in <em>Summerball25</em> if they will be moving up NEXT season for
            three key reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span>Better Competition</span> – Local leagues (Ballard, Magnolia, Queen Anne, Shoreline, and more)
                have agreed to align divisions based on where players will be in Spring of '26, creating balanced teams.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Low-Stakes, High-Growth</span> – With All-Stars out playing tournaments, it's the perfect time to
                safely adjust, take on new challenges, and build confidence in the new division.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Head Start for Spring 2026</span> – Getting early reps at the next level helps players settle in
                and succeed when the regular season begins.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The matrix below provides guidance on selecting the appropriate <em>Summerball25</em> division, but the
            answer may come easier by asking yourself this question <span>— where will my player play next year?</span>
            If there is even a chance, then give it a go<sup>1</sup>!
