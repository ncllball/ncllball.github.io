            <em>Sandlot</em> format means kids show up and teams are picked based on who is there and ready to play
            ball. This creates a flexible drop-in format with no commitment to one team, allowing families to come
            and go as their schedule allows.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>2</sup>
            Based on the 2024 schedule: Single-A scheduled games were Mondays (2), Tuesdays (3), Wednesdays (1), and
            Thursdays (4), totaling 10 games.

            Participation in Summerball25 does not determine the division your player will be assigned to for Spring
            '26; division placement will be based on league age and skill level at that time.
