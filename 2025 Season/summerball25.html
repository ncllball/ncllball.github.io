    <div class="footies">
        <p>*Sandlot style means the kids show up and we pick teams based on who is there and ready to play ball. This
            way, there is no commitment to one team and families can come and go</p>
        <p>**Games will be held on Mondays (2 Monday games), Tuesdays (3), Wednesdays (1), and Thursdays (4) for a total
            of 10 games.</p>
