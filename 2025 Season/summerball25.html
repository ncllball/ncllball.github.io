    <section>
        <h2 class="left">Single-A Baseball Summerball25</h2>
        <p>We are excited to offer our single-A families the chance to get some baseball in this summer! Here are the details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Games will be sandlot style*, meaning maximum flexibility for families over the summer.</li>
            <li>Players will have been in single-A or Coach Pitch already &mdash; <strong>NOT</strong> directly from T-Ball.</li>
            <li>Games will begin at either 5:00 or 5:30 at Ross Field or Lower Woodland.</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANTLY &mdash; we need <strong>VOLUNTEERS</strong> to make this work so signup here and I will be reaching out. 
                ANYONE can sign up to help regardless of coaching experience!!!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please reach out to me with questions: <a href="mailto:registrar@ncllball.com">registrar@ncllball.com</a></p>

    <!-- Single-A Footer Notes -->
    <section class="footies">
        <p>*Sandlot style means the kids show up and we pick teams based on who is there and ready to play ball. 
           This way, there is no commitment to one team and families can come and go</p>
        <p>**Games will be held on Mondays (2 Monday games), Tuesdays (3), Wednesdays (1), and Thursdays (4) for a total of 10 games.</p>
