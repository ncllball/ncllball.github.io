    <!-- Why Play Up in Summerball25 Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="left">Why Play Up in <em>Summerball25</em>?</h2>
        <p>
            We encourage kids to move up a division in <em>Summerball25</em> if they will be moving up NEXT season for
            three key reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Better Competition</span> – Local leagues (Ballard, Magnolia, Queen Anne, Shoreline, and more)
                have agreed to align divisions based on where players will be in the fall, creating balanced, meaningful
                games.</li>
            <li><span>Low-Stakes, High-Growth</span> – With All-Stars out playing tournaments, it's the perfect time to
                safely adjust, take on new challenges, and build confidence in the new division.</li>
            <li><span>Head Start for Fall</span> – Getting early reps at the next level helps players settle in and
                succeed when the regular season begins.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The matrix below provides guidance on selecting the appropriate <em>Summerball25</em> division, but the
            answer may come easier by asking yourself this question — where will my player play next year? If there is
            even a chance, then give it a
            go<sup>1</sup>! </p>
