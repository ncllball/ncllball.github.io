            <h2 class="left">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

            <h4 class="left">Q: What if my child cannot make the scheduled tryout date?</h4>
            <p>A: For Baseball, attendance is highly recommended but not mandatory. For Softball, please contact Gayle Perez
                regarding assessments. Coaches evaluate players throughout the season, including their performance in games,
                practices, and overall attitude. Tryout attendance is just one factor in the selection process, and missing
                the tryout does not automatically disqualify a player from being considered for the team.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: What does "availability for the District Tournament is a requirement" mean?</h4>
            <p>A: It means your child must be able to attend all scheduled games during the District 8 tournament for their
                age group. If you have unavoidable conflicts during this period, you should discuss this prior to accepting
                a roster spot, or it may impact selection, as consistent team presence is crucial for All-Stars.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: What is the process for selecting the players for the All-Star teams?</h4>
            <p>A: Regular-season coaches and any co-league representatives select the players for each All-Star team. The
                selection process is consensus-based per Little League Rules and NCLL Local Rules. The objective is to
                fairly and impartially select the most skilled, available, and competitive team possible to represent NCLL
                in tournament play. Selection is conducted in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of the
                decision-making process and best serves the interests of fair and impartial selection.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: What documents will we need to provide if selected?</h4>
            <p>A: District 8 requires an original birth certificate and proof of residency or a school enrollment form.
                Team staff will tell you exactly what to bring and when. Please don’t upload documents publicly—bring them
                to your team when requested.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: Can a younger player be considered for an older All-Stars age group?</h4>
            <p>A: Tournament divisions are defined by <em>League Age</em> brackets (8–10, 9–11, 10–12, Juniors 13–14,
                Seniors 15–16). Players are only eligible for brackets that include their League Age. Within a bracket,
                coaches/VPs consider team needs and fit.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: How much does All-Stars cost and what uniform items are included?</h4>
            <p>A: There’s no registration fee. A uniform fee will be charged (scholarships available). That typically
                covers a tournament jersey and hat. Players supply pants, belt, socks, and personal gear (glove, bat,
                helmet) unless told otherwise by the team.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: What if we have a vacation, camp, or other conflict during the tournament window?</h4>
            <p>A: Availability for the District Tournament is required to make a team. If you have unavoidable conflicts,
                please discuss them <em>before</em> accepting a roster spot. Significant conflicts can affect selection and
                team continuity.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: How large are All-Star rosters? Are alternates used?</h4>
            <p>A: Rosters are typically 12–14 players (Little League minimum is 12). Alternates are not rostered players.
                If injuries or special situations arise, the league works with the District Administrator per Little League
                rules.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: Can my player join All-Stars and a summer/travel team at the same time?</h4>
            <p>A: Many families juggle both, but June/July is busy. Once you accept a roster spot, NCLL All-Star practices,
                scrimmages, and official games should be the priority. Ongoing conflicts can impact playing time or
                selection.</p>

            <h4 class="left">Q: How will schedules and updates be shared with families?</h4>
            <p>A: Email is our primary channel. Managers share practice schedules directly with teams, and we’ll update
                this page with key dates. Please make sure your SportsConnect account email is current.</p>
