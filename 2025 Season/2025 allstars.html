        <h2 class="left">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

        <h4 class="left">Q: What if my child cannot make the scheduled tryout date?</h4>
        <p>A: For Baseball, attendance is highly recommended but not mandatory. For Softball, please contact Gayle Perez
            regarding assessments. Coaches evaluate players throughout the season, including their performance in games,
            practices, and overall attitude. Tryout attendance is just one factor in the selection process, and missing
            the tryout does not automatically disqualify a player from being considered for the team.</p>

        <h4 class="left">Q: What does "availability for the District Tournament is a requirement" mean?</h4>
        <p>A: It means your child must be able to attend all scheduled games during the District 8 tournament for their
            age group. If you have unavoidable conflicts during this period, you should discuss this prior to accepting
            a roster spot, or it may impact selection, as consistent team presence is crucial for All-Stars.</p>

        <h4 class="left">Q: What is the process for selecting the players for the All-Star teams?</h4>
        <p>A: Regular-season coaches and any co-league representatives select the players for each All-Star team. The
            selection process is consensus-based per Little League Rules and NCLL Local Rules. The objective is to
            fairly and impartially select the most skilled, available, and competitive team possible to represent NCLL
            in tournament play. Selection is conducted in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of the
            decision-making process and best serves the interests of fair and impartial selection.</p>
