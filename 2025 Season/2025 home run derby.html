            A Community
            Celebration of Softball and Baseball!</h2>
        <p><span>Get ready for a highlight of the season!</span> North Central Little League is thrilled to announce our
            annual Home Run Derby, taking place in just over a week. Mark your calendars and join us for an evening of
            thrilling competition, community spirit, and family fun at Lower Woodland Park.</p>
        <p>This beloved event celebrates the hard work and dedication of our Majors Softball and Baseball players as
            they
            showcase their power-hitting skills on Field #6. We invite all NCLL families, friends, and supporters to
            come
            out and cheer on these talented athletes.</p>
        <p>Make an evening of it! Bring a picnic to enjoy in the cloverleaf area or plan your team party right at the
            field.
            To make the event even sweeter, we'll be providing delicious Seattle Pops for all NCLL players and their
            siblings to enjoy while they take in the action. We encourage all our young fans to wear their NCLL jerseys
            and
            bring their mitts â€“ you might even catch a home run ball that clears the fence and have a chance to get
            autographs from our contestants after the competition!</p>
