                for a fun-filled evening of thrilling competition, community spirit, and family fun at <span>Lower

            <h2 class="left">The Main Event</h2>
            <p>This beloved event celebrates the hard work and dedication of our <span>Majors Softball and Baseball
                    players (11-12 year-old players)</span> as they showcase their power-hitting skills on a modified Field #6. We invite all NCLL families,
                friends, and supporters to come out and cheer on these talented athletes.</p>
            <p>Make a night of it! Bring a picnic to enjoy in the grassy cloverleaf area or plan a team party right at
                the field. To make the evening even sweeter, we'll be providing delicious Seattle Pops for all NCLL
                players and their siblings to enjoy. We encourage all our young fans to wear their NCLL jerseys and
                bring their mittsâ€”you might just catch a home run ball that clears the fence! After the competition,
                stick around for a chance to get autographs from the contestants.</p>
