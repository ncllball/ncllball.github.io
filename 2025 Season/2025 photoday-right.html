    <p>This year, we're working with a new photography vendor. Due to their limited availability, Photo Day 2025
        will be
        scheduled across multiple dates.</p>

    <p>We understand this may present some scheduling challenges, particularly for families with children in
        different
        divisions. We've carefully organized the schedule to minimize conflicts. Additional details about specific
        times
        and locations will be announced soon via email and posted here.</p>

    <p>Team photos are an essential part of the Little League experience, and we appreciate your flexibility. Don't
        miss
        this opportunity to capture these special memories!</p>

    <p>Pictures are taken at Lower Woodland over by the batting cages (outer left field of LW Field #5.) If you are there for just the photos, the best parking (if available) would be the tenniscourt side parking lot as it is right down that hill. We look forward to seeing you!</p>
