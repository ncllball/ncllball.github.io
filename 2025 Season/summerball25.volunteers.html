        <p>Hello NCLL Baseball and Softball Families!</p>
        <p>We're so excited for the 2024 Summer Ball season, but we need your help to ensure it runs smoothly for all
            our players!</p>
                    <p>Sign up today, grab your glove, and get ready to hit the field!</p>

        <h2 class="left">What we need:</h2>
        <p>We are still looking for parent volunteers to help with coaching and managing teams. We know vacations will
            happen, and that's okay! Even if you can only help with a few games, every little bit counts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Head Coach Role:</span> We need parents to bring the gear, help set up the game, keep the kids
                safe, and handle any unusual situations. It's easy and fun, and the kids love having the freedom to
                manage themselves. The more advanced players can help coach bases as long as they wear a batting helmet!
            </li>
            <li><span>Assistant Coach Role:</span> We need adult dugout managers, base coaches, and umpires (and a
                parent pitcher for AA). AAA kids love coaching bases too, just keep it safe!</li>
            <li><span>Team Manager Role:</span> For A-sandlot, a group of committed parents works best to create parity,
                fun, and safety.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><span>AA/AAA Baseball &amp; Softball Sandlot:</span> We need adult dugout managers, base coaches, and

            <li><span>A Baseball Sandlot:</span> For A-sandlot, a group of committed parents works best to create

            <p>We are excited to offer our single-A families the chance to get some baseball in this summer! Here are
                the details:</p>
            <p><em>*Sandlot style means the kids show up and teams are based on who is there and ready to play ball.
                    This way, there is no commitment to one team and families can come and go.</em></p>
