            <span class="left">Lead Game Volunteer (Head Coach):</span>
            Be a key presence at games. Responsibilities include bringing team gear, helping with setup, ensuring
            safety, and handling any unusual situations. Especially needed for Majors and Teen Baseball. Advanced
            players can help coach bases (with a helmet).
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="left">Game Day Helper (Assistant Coach):</span> Provide on-field supportâ€”dugout manager, base
            coach,
            umpire, or parent pitcher (for AA). Especially needed for AA/AAA Baseball and Softball Sandlot. AAA
            players may help coach bases (with supervision).
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="left">Team Manager (Off-Field Support & Logistics):</span> Organize RSVPs, coordinate snacks, and help
            communicate with families. Great for those who prefer non-coaching roles. Keeps everyone informed and
            organized.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="left">Sandlot Team Organizer (A-Baseball Sandlot):</span> Work with other parents to organize players,
            balance teams, maintain a fun atmosphere, and oversee safety. This collaborative role is key to the
            flexible, "show up and play" sandlot style.
