            <li>
                <span>Lead Game Volunteer (Head Coach):</span>
                Bring team gear, help with setup, ensure safety, and handle unusual situations.

            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Game Day Helper (Assistant Coach):</span>
                Provide on-field support—dugout manager, base coach, umpire, or parent pitcher (AA).
                Especially needed for AA/AAA Baseball and Softball Sandlot. AAA players may coach bases (with supervision).
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Team Manager (Off-field logistics):</span>
                Organize RSVPs, coordinate snacks, and help communicate with families. Great for non-coaching volunteers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Sandlot Team Organizer (A Baseball Sandlot):</span>
                Partner with other parents to organize players, balance teams, keep it fun, and oversee safety.
