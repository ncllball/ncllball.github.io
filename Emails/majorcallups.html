<div id="content"><h4>Dear NCLL Families,</h4>
<p>We want to take a moment to thank you for your commitment to NCLL and for participating in this season’s assessments. Our drafts have concluded, and before rosters go out this afternoon, we wanted to inform you that while your player will officially be on a AAA roster this season, they are one of 15 to earn the designation of “Majors Call-Up”.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>What This Means</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Your player will be rostered on both a AAA and a Majors team</li>
<li>They will have the opportunity to practice with both teams throughout the season, potentially playing baseball four nights a week if they want</li>
<li>If a Majors team needs additional players for a game, we will review GameChanger availability and call up players as needed</li>
<li>This designation is intended to give players additional development opportunities while ensuring Majors teams have the necessary roster depth throughout the season and we suggest </li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Your player’s AAA coach will be in touch with details about practices and games</li>
<li>Majors teams will also reach out regarding practice opportunities</li>
<li>We ask that you keep your player’s GameChanger availability up to date so we can properly manage call-ups</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. We’re looking forward to a great season and can’t wait to see your player grow!</p>
<h4>Best,</h4>
