<h2 class="left" id="greetings-ncll-baseball-softball-and-tee-ball-families">Greetings NCLL Baseball, Softball, and Tee-Ball Families!</h2>
<p>Registration for North Central Little League’s 2025 Season is now open!&nbsp; We look forward to our new and returning families joining us for another great season of fun on the diamond. Please read important updates below and spread the word to your neighbors and school families to join you at North Central Little League (NCLL) this spring! Many thanks to our volunteers who dedicated their time in the offseason to get us ready for next season!</p>
<h4 class="left" id="ncll-changes-this-year">NCLL Changes This Year</h4>
<ul>
<li>Little League® mandated all leagues move to Sports Connect this year. We migrated over from Sports Engine during the off season. SC does not have an APP. However, they <a href="https://sportsconnect.com/2020/08/28/spotlight-gamechanger-team-manager-mobile-app/">sync</a> with Game Changer, a widely used gameday app at NCLL and most other leagues. To sync, you need to use the <a class="ncll" href="https://teammanager.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006893592-Importing-Your-Team-From-Sports-Connect">same email address for both accounts.</a> We’ll provide more instructions on Gamechanger as the start of the season approaches.</li>
<li>We are also migrating all of NCLL's disparate digital bits and pieces to Google Workspace for Nonprofits. It's a big move and we're excited to see how it makes us more efficient. So please be patient as emails will soon begin changing to <a class="ncll" href="">@ncllball.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="left" id="registration-updates">Registration Updates</h4>
<ul>
<li>This year's registration is more aggressive in asking for proof of eligibility, but please note: IT IS NOT REQUIRED</li>
<li>Players outside <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768">our boundary</a> will need a waiver to play for NCLL, and would not be eligible for postseason tournaments</li>
<li>Players aged 9-14 should be registered by Jan. 23 to make sure you don’t miss player <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112173">assessments</a>.</li>
<li>Uniforms are ordered based upon the size you enter in the registration -- please check your sizes, we don't want anyone to incur the $25 fee the uniform vendor charges for resizes</li>
<li>Scholarships for all divisions are available by request prior to registration <a class="ncll" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5JIcH7zLuLGVLSBSXHIOhbOtgYmP8rkW5w86_wB36zEbuoQ/viewform">(financial aid request form)</a></li>
<li>Last year, registration filled up fast, so sign up right away if you want to play!</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="left" id="volunteers-and-donations">Volunteers and Donations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unlike previous years, volunteer registration is now integrated with the program and season. Visit Sports Connect or our <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=1932700">Volunteers Page</a>.</li>
<li>We need volunteers for projects of many different shapes and sizes, both on the field and off. Some require baseball knowledge, but many DO NOT, e.g. back office/administrative work. Maybe you're a detail oriented organizer, or experienced fundraiser, or wrangler of the little ones; whatever it is, please let us know if you have the bandwidth to pitch in (pun intended) and help out! Register as a Key Volunteer and let us know what you are thinking about.</li>
<li>Corporate matching for volunteer hours can be a big fundraising driver and help keep our registration fees affordable year after year. Please ask your company if they match volunteer hours. (NCLL is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization)</li>
