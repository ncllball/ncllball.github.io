<p><strong>Subject</strong>: NCLL ASSESSMENTS and Help Wanted</p>
<p>Hello NCLL Families!</p>
<p>First, we have a GREAT volunteer opportunity we're looking to fill -- the position of <a class="ncll" 
        href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=1932694">NCLL Scheduler</a>. This is a REALLY important
    position and great opportunity to truly make a difference for the kids. <strong>Even if it's not for
        you,</strong> we ask that you go take a look and send the link to someone you think would be a good fit!</p>
<p>Next, <strong>assessments</strong> for players entering AAA and Majors in both Baseball and Softball are coming
    up on January 25th and February 8th, respectively. Assessments are <strong>MANDATORY</strong> for all players
    hoping to play in these divisions.</p>
<p>Visit the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112173">assessments page</a> to learn more, sign
    up your player, and volunteer to help. There are plenty of roles for folks of all baseball knowledge. If you are
    interested in or already slotted to coach in 2025, please let us know if you will <strong>not</strong> be able
    to make it for a little. Otherwise, we look forward to getting everyone together! </p>
<p>Thanks for the support!</p>
