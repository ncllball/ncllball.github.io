        <h4 class="left">Hi all!</h4>
        <p>If you've ever shown up to a game at the Cloverleaf and marveled at how a field looks after a night of rain, just know it didn't get that way because of Parks/Rec or the magical baseball gnomes, it was done by us volunteers.</p>

        <figure>

            <figcaption>This is the NCLL Fields Bat Signal. When this goes up, it means we need your help.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>If you are on this list, it means you have a game tomorrow at Lower Woodland Ballfields. It also means rain is in the forecast and your help may be needed to ensure we can get those games in. It's late in the season, we are living on borrowed time (field time, that is), and we all want to get these games in and on to our playoffs.</p>
        <p>Our ask is pretty simple â€” check your messages anytime after 7AM and if we throw up the Fields Bat Signal, grab a garden rake or maybe a leaf blower (with a bunch of batteries or a plugin as we have a generator) and head down to the fields and we'll get you to work.</p>
        <p>So get ready to be a hero and look at those messages in the morning!</p>
        <h4 class="left">Thanks!</h4>
