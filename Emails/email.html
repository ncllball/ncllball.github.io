Got it! Here's the updated content with the chart formatted more clearly:

<div id="content">
  <h3 id="registration-numbers">Registration Numbers</h3>
  <p>I was curious about our progress, so I analyzed the data. The numbers to the left of the '/' are the number of registrants we had on January 8th in that year. The number to the right of the '/' is the TOTAL number of registrants we had that year.</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th id="year" style="text-align:center;">Year</th>
        <th id="players" style="text-align:center;">Players</th>
        <th id="volunteers" style="text-align:center;">Volunteers</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center;">2022</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">310 / 702</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">45 / 279</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center;">2023</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">405 / 748</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">66 / 320</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center;">2024</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">412 / 760</td>
        <td style="text-align:center;">60 / 302</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center;" colspan="3">We are trending similarly with the number of kids registered and should match the totals from 2022, 2023, and 2024.</td>

  <p>Regarding volunteers, we are surpassing expectations for two key reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Improved Presentation by Sports Connect</strong>: Volunteer opportunities are showcased more effectively</li>
    <li><strong>Streamlined Position Names</strong>: I've simplified and clarified the position titles. (I talked about this at the last Board meeting.)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There is a discrepancy between the LLI nomenclature and what resonates with our families, particularly between 'Team Manager' and 'Head Coach'. Using 'Team Manager' for a head coach confuses families and diminishes the role our parents understand as 'Team Manager' (team parent role). Therefore, for 2025, I updated the terms to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Team Manager</li>
    <li>Head Coach</li>
    <li>Assistant Coach</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I wanted to clarify these terms to avoid confusion for those accustomed to the previous terminology. For 2025, these are the terms NCLL will be using.</p>
