    <p>When it comes to baseball bats, "drop" is the term used to describe the difference between the bat's length (in inches)
        and its weight (in ounces). This is calculated as weight - length = drop. For instance, a bat that is 28 inches long
        and weighs 15 ounces would have a drop of -13 (15-28 = -13).</p>
