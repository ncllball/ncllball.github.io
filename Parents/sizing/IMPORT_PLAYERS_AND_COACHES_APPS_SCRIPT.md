# Apps Script: Import Players and Coaches CSVs into Google Sheet

Paste this into Extensions â†’ Apps Script in your Google Sheet, then run `importPlayersAndCoaches` and authorize the script when prompted. It will create two tabs named "Players (imported)" and "Coaches (imported)" and populate them with the tables.

```javascript
function importPlayersAndCoaches() {
  const playersCsv = `Program/Division,Hat Model #,Shirt Model #,Hoodie Model #

  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();

    // Remove existing sheet if present
    const existing = ss.getSheetByName(sheetName);
    if (existing) ss.deleteSheet(existing);

    // Parse CSV lines to arrays
    const rows = csv.trim().split('\n').map(function(line) {
      return Utilities.parseCsv(line)[0];
    });

    // Create and populate sheet
    const sh = ss.insertSheet(sheetName);
    sh.getRange(1, 1, rows.length, rows[0].length).setValues(rows);
    sh.getRange(1,1,1,rows[0].length).setFontWeight('bold');

}

Notes
- The script writes only to the current Google Sheet (the one you open the Apps Script editor from).
- The script deletes and recreates the two target tabs each time it runs.
- If you'd rather have the data appended instead of replacing, I can modify the script to append rows.
- If you want the CSVs pulled from a raw URL or a repo file, I can adjust the script to fetch them instead (would require the files to be hosted and accessible).
