# SIZE & LENGTH CARDS

## Legend — measurement conventions

- Pit-to-pit (PTP): the flat measurement taken straight across the front of the garment, from one armpit seam to the other. This is a "diameter"-style measurement and is expressed in inches.
- Circumference (CIRC): the full chest circumference — equal to 2 × Pit-to-pit. We prefer using pit-to-pit (PTP) on NCLL because it's the direct flat measurement used for sizing and easier to compare between suppliers.
- Body Length: measured from the highest point at the back (or front when noted) to the hem, expressed in inches.

Notes:
- Where a table column is labelled "1/2 Chest" or "Chest" in the original supplier sheet, we treat that value as pit-to-pit (PTP) for the normalized table below. If you have supplier sheets where "Chest" is a circumference, tell me and I will convert by dividing the circumference by 2.
- All normalized tables below explicitly show Pit-to-pit (PTP) values so you can use them consistently when ordering.
