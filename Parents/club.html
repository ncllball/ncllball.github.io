    <title>What is 'Select', 'Club', and 'Travel Ball'?</title>
</head>
<body>
<section>
    <p>Exploring the "ifs" and "whos" of committing to a club/select/travel team can be daunting.</p>
    <p>NCLL aims to help by providing introductions to local club teams through various programs throughout the year, giving you a chance to get to know the coaches and for them to get to know your player. It's a great way to see if your child is ready—or even desires—to take that next step in the level of competition.</p>
    <p>Below are the key distinctions and to the right, a brief description of the local programs.</p>
    <p class="footies"><span>NOTE</span>: While many within NCLL have differing opinions and views on this aspect of kids' baseball and softball, we generally agree that starting at age 7-8 is early, and in the case of softball, difficult to find. Focus on fun and a love of the game.</p>

    <h2 class="left">Recreational Leagues (e.g., Little League, PONY, etc.)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>These leagues typically begin with Tee Ball, which can start for children as young as 4 years old.</li>
        <li>Progression through divisions (coach-pitch, player-pitch, etc.) occurs through the pre-teen years.</li>
        <li>The emphasis is on participation, learning fundamentals, and having fun.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="left">Club Programs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased travel and practice come with an increased cost, both financially and of your time.</li>
        <li>These programs are generally more competitive and require tryouts.</li>
        <li>They can begin at a wide range of ages, but it's increasingly common to see them start as early as 7 or 8 years old.</li>
        <li>However, the most common time that players begin participating in these programs is around ages 9 through 12.</li>
        <li>These programs often involve more travel, a greater time commitment, and a higher level of competition.</li>
        <li>The goal is often to develop players for higher levels of baseball/softball, such as high school and college.</li>
        <li>There are often multiple teams within one program for different skill levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="left">Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The age at which a child enters a club program varies depending on the organization and the level of competition.</li>
        <li>It's important to maintain a healthy balance between sports and other activities.</li>
        <li>Every child develops at their own rate.</li>
        <li>Consider your child's physical, emotional, and social development when deciding whether to enter a club program.</li>
        <li>Costs—both financial and time—must be factored into your decision.</li>
