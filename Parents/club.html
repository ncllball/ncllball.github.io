    <title>What is Select/Club/Travel Ball?</title>
</head>

<section>

    <p>Exploring the "IF's" and "WHO's" of the comittment to a club/select/travel team can be daunting. </p>
    <p>NCLL attempts to
        help
        by providing an introduction to local club teams through various programs throughout the year. It allows you a
        chance
        to get to know the coaches and them to get to know your child. It's a great way to see if your child is ready —
        or even desires — to take that next step in the level of competition.
    </p>
    <p>Below are the key distinctions and a list of the local club teams.</p>
    <p class="footies"><span>NOTE</span>: While many of us within NCLL have differing opinions and views on this aspect
        of
        kids baseball and softball, we generally agree that 7-8 is early, and in the case of
        softball, difficult to find. Focus on fun and a love of the game.</p>

    <h2 class="left">Recreational Leagues (e.g., Little League)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>These leagues typically begin with Tee Ball, which can start for children as young as 4 years old.</li>
        <li>Progression through divisions (coach-pitch, player-pitch, etc.) occurs through the pre-teen years.</li>
        <li>The emphasis is on participation, learning fundamentals, and having fun.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="left">Club Programs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased travel and practice come with increased cost both financially and with your time.
        </li>
        <li>These programs are generally more competitive and require tryouts.</li>
        <li>They can begin at a wide range of ages, but it's increasingly common to see them start as early as 7 or 8
            years old</li>
        <li>However, the most common time that players begin participating in these programs is around the ages of 9
            through 12.</li>
        <li>These programs often involve more travel, a greater time commitment, and a higher level of competition.</li>
        <li>The goal is often to develop players for higher levels of baseball/softball, such as high school and
            college.</li>
        <li>There are often multiple teams within one program of different skilled players.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="left">Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The age at which a child enters a club program varies depending on the organization and the level
            of
            competition.</li>
        <li>There's a trend toward younger ages in select baseball/softball, but it's crucial to ensure that children
            maintain a
            healthy balance between sports and other activities.</li>
        <li>It is important to remember that every child develops at their own rate.</li>
        <li>It's essential to consider the child's physical, emotional, and social development when deciding whether to
            enter a
            club program.</li>
        <li>Costs — both finanical and time — must be factored into your decision.</li>
    </ul>
