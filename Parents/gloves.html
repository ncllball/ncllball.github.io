    <h2 class="left">Helpful Tips for Selecting the Right Glove</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Consider the Position Played:</span> Glove designs are often tailored for specific positions (e.g., infield gloves are smaller, while outfield gloves are larger to help catch fly balls).</li>
        <li><span>Test the Glove's Fit:</span> The glove should feel snug but not too tight. Make sure it’s easy to open and close.</li>
        <li><span>Break-In Period:</span> New gloves can feel stiff at first, so encourage your player to wear them and practice catching regularly to break them in</li>
        <li><span>Material Choices:</span> Leather vs synthetic -- Higher quality and more durable but take longer to break-in vs.lightweight, affordable, and easier to break in but less durable.</li>
        <li><span>Budget-Friendly Options:</span> Many brands offer high-quality gloves at lower price points. Look for sales, especially during the offseason.</li>
