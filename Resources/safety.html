			<h2 class="left" id="safety-letter">Letter from the Safety Officer</h2>
			<p>Dear NCLL families,</p>
			<p>Player safety is our first priority, from Tee through Teen. Our board, coaches, umpires, and volunteers follow Little League International’s A Safety Awareness Program (ASAP) and update our plan every year before Opening Day. That plan includes coach certifications, concussion and abuse-awareness training, heat/lightning protocols, field inspections, and rapid incident reporting.</p>
			<p>Thank you for partnering with us: reviewing our safety links, completing required trainings, and helping us keep every practice and game welcoming and secure. If you have questions or see something we need to address, please reach out anytime.</p>
			<p>Play hard, be safe, and see you at the Cloverleaf!</p>
			<p><strong>Phil Garfin</strong><br />Safety Officer, North Central Little League<br /><a class="ncll" href="mailto:safety@ncllball.com">safety@ncllball.com</a></p>
