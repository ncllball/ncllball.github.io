# Player Development Tag Strip Reference (2025)

This document captures the standardized tag strip items (the top metadata list) for each 2025 Player Development (PD) program page. Order is preserved exactly as it appears in each file. This serves as a quick audit / source-of-truth for consistency and future automation (e.g., generating summaries or status badges).

### Aggregate Label Inventory

Canonical set (target order):

- Dates
- Location
- Day (optional; used when a recurring weekday is a core attribute)
- Time
- Sessions (alternate to Time for multi-slot programs where session times are the key attribute)
- Cost
- Age Group (optional when Division(s) already encodes scope or broad span)
- Division(s)
- Led by

Variations currently in use (post Day-tag adoption on Teen & In-Season SB Pitching):

- Pages WITH Age Group tag: (none at present — Single-A line removed pending policy decision).
- Pages WITHOUT Age Group tag: All current PD pages.
- Pages WITH Day tag: Teen BB, In-Season SB Pitching.
- Pages WITHOUT Day tag: all others (either non-weekly recurrence, variable days, variable-day span, or discrete date list focus).

Observation: Temporary full omission of Age Group across PD. Decision needed: (a) reintroduce uniformly, (b) restrict to narrow single-level offerings, or (c) keep omitted and rely on Division(s) + body Eligibility.

Capitalization normalization applied:

- “AA - Seniors” (spaced hyphen)
- “AA & Up” (ampersand + Title Case Up)
- “League Age” capitalized

Recommended future enforcement: a linter should flag missing Age Group unless:

1) Division(s) spans 3+ adjacent levels (e.g., AA - Seniors or AA & Up), OR
2) Body copy introduces explicit League Age / Grades span within first two sections, OR
3) Program intentionally broad (e.g., pitching clinics) — documented with an inline HTML comment near the tag strip.

### Machine-Readable Attributes Coverage Snapshot

| Page | Dates Mode | Time Structure | Cost Attrs | Age Data | Division Attrs | Led by Attrs |
|------|------------|---------------|-----------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Teen BB | range (data-range-start/end) | fixed weekly (day + start/end) | status=tbd | (missing – was age-min/max) | sport+levels+scope | coach name |
| Single-A | list (data-dates) | multi-slot (slot-count + per-slot) | amount/unit/status | (none) | sport+levels+scope | coach + org |
| Double-AA Pitching | list | 2 options (option1/2) | amount/unit | (missing) | sport+levels+scope | organization |
| AAA+MAJ SB | list | start/end + duration | free + sponsor | (missing – implicit via divisions) | sport+levels+scope | coach |
| AAA+MAJ BB | range | variable descriptor | amount/unit | (missing – was age-min/max) | sport+levels+scope | staffing levels |
| RHS Batting | list | pipe-separated discrete times | amount/unit | grade span (text only) | sport+levels+scope | org name |
| LHS Camp | single date | start/end + duration | amount/unit | ages span (text only) | multi-level span | org + affiliation |
| In-Season SB Pitching | list | two sessions (session1/2) | free | (omitted) | sport+levels+scope | coach + affiliations |
| Free February | list | sessions-per-date + duration | free | league age range | sport+levels+scope | org + staffing |

Gaps / Enhancements:

- Decide policy: permanently omit Age Group from broad-scope or multi-level pages OR reintroduce it for absolute consistency.
- Standardize grade/age textual patterns into data attributes where missing (RHS Batting grades, LHS ages span) even if not shown as a tag.
- Consider `data-status` (e.g., `open`, `upcoming`, `closed`, `free`) for automation.

### Potential Follow-Ups

- Generate `pd-programs.json` manifest.
- Implement linter script (HTML parser) to enforce ordering & label/capitalization.
- Add `data-status` & surface status badges inline (not only on landing page).
- Backfill missing Age Group lines or document permanent exceptions.
- Convert TBD pricing once confirmed.
- Add normalization rule: all free items use `$0 / <unit> (FREE[; sponsor])`; TBD keeps unit in data-cost-unit for future substitution.

Let me know if you’d like JSON, CSV, or an automated extractor next.
