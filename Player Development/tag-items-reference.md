### Aggregate Label Inventory

All labels currently in use across PD tag strips (expected canonical set):

- Dates
- Location
- Time
- Cost
- Age Group
- Division(s)
- Led by

No deviations detected. (One page uses a slightly extended parenthetical for Led by attribution; acceptable.)

### Potential Follow-Ups

- Add a machine-readable JSON export for automation (e.g., `pd-programs.json`).
- Introduce a status field (Open / Closed / Free / Coming Soon) in the tag strip or via data-* attributes.
- Convert TBD pricing to final value once published (Teen Training).

Let me know if you’d like the JSON or CSV variants generated.
