            <p>Is your AA baseball player ready to take the mound this season? Do you like shorter games because the
                kids
                are nailing the strike zone? If so, let's do our part and make sure they’re prepared to take the mound
                this
                season!</p>
            <p>NCLL is excited to offer a specialized pitching clinic tailored specifically for AA baseball players
                looking
                to pitch.</p>
            <p>Your player will be guided by a member of NORTHWEST STING BASEBALL’S coaching staff, all of whom have
                extensive pitching
                experience as both instructors and players. Parents, coaches, and assistant coaches are welcome to stay,
                watch,
