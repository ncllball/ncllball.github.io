    <h2 class="left" id="overview">Program Overview</h2>
        <p>Is your AA baseball player ready to take the mound this season? Do you like shorter games because the kids
            are nailing the strike zone? If so, let's do our part and make sure they’re prepared to take the mound this
            season!</p>
        <p>NCLL is excited to offer a specialized pitching clinic tailored specifically for AA baseball players looking
            to pitch.</p>
        <p>Your player will be guided by a member of NORTHWEST STING BASEBALL’S coaching staff, all of whom have
            extensive pitching
            experience as both instructors and players. Parents, coaches, and assistant coaches are welcome to stay,
            watch,
            or participate in these sessions.</p>
