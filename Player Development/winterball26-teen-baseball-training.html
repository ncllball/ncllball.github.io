            <h2 class="left" id="overview">Program Overview</h2>
            <p>Winterball26 Teen Baseball Training is a 15-session indoor series for league-age 13-16 players who want consistent, high-intensity reps before high school and upper-division seasons. Coach Ray Atkinson builds confident hitters and healthy arms through small-group work that emphasizes pattern building, decision-making, and durable athletic movement.</p>
            <p>Sessions run every Sunday night (8:00-9:30 PM) at Focus Baseball. Only 12 roster spots are available to preserve individualized feedback; once full, a waitlist opens and a second Sunday block (6:30-8:00 PM) will launch if demand allows.</p>
