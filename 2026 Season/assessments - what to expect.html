      <p><strong>Assessments are not tryouts.</strong> Every player makes a team. Assessments help NCLL place players in the right division and build competitive balance across teams so games are fun, safe, and development stays the priority.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="who">
      <h2 class="left" id="who">Who are assessments for?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Players in divisions where teams are formed via a parity-focused process (often AAA &amp; Majors; sometimes additional divisions depending on the sport/season).</li>
        <li>Players playing up requests or players on the bubble between two divisions&mdash;&quot;assessments help us make safer, fairer decisions.</li>
        <li>Returning players and new players alike; each season is a fresh snapshot.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="why">
      <h2 class="left" id="why">Why do we do assessments?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Competitive balance:</strong> Little League requires parity; assessments help distribute pitching, catching, hitting, and defense across rosters.</li>
        <li><strong>Better development:</strong> Players learn faster when the game speed matches their current skills&mdash;&quot;challenging but not overwhelming.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Placement reduces mismatch risk and helps coaches plan roles responsibly.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear expectations:</strong> Coaches start the season with a shared baseline and can build practice plans accordingly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="what-happens">
      <h2 class="left" id="what-happens">What happens at assessments?</h2>
      <p>Assessments run like a fast-moving practice with stations. Exact stations vary by sport/division, but commonly include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Throwing &amp; catching:</strong> arm strength, accuracy, receiving, and basic footwork.</li>
        <li><strong>Fielding:</strong> ground balls, fly balls, glove-to-hand transfer, throws from different spots.</li>
        <li><strong>Hitting:</strong> tee/front toss reps to see swing mechanics, contact, and approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Running:</strong> home-to-first timing and basic base-running cues.</li>
        <li><strong>Pitching/catching:</strong> when applicable, evaluated as a station within the session window.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="footies" aria-label="Assessment environment note">
      <p><span class="info-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>Staff work hard to create a consistent, supportive environment. The goal is quality reps, not pressure.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="how-used">
      <h2 class="left" id="how-used">How are results used?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To help the Player Agent and division leads create balanced teams and to support parity-focused drafts when applicable. Read the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA Draft Overview</a> for how assessments feed team formation.</li>
        <li>To guide safe placement decisions (including play up requests) alongside coach feedback and roster availability.</li>
        <li>To help coaches plan early roles and practice priorities&mdash;&quot;not to label players.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="prep">
      <h2 class="left" id="prep">How should families prepare?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bring:</strong> glove, water, weather-appropriate layers, and shoes appropriate to the surface; helmet is often recommended; bat optional.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrive early:</strong> plan for check-in and a short warm-up before your scheduled start.</li>
        <li><strong>Encourage effort:</strong> tell your player it's &quot;show your current skills&quot; day, not &quot;make the team&quot; day.</li>
        <li><strong>Help out:</strong> volunteering (even for a small role) keeps the day organized and gives kids more reps. New to NCLL? Visit the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2117276" rel="noopener">Volunteer Hub</a>.</li>

    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="faq">
      <h2 class="left" id="faq">Quick FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Is this a tryout?</strong> No. All players will be placed on a team.</li>
        <li><strong>What if we can't attend?</strong> Each season has specific rules (some have no alternate date). Contact the emails on the current season's assessments page as early as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Can parents stay?</strong> Yes. Please keep walkways clear and follow volunteer instructions so stations stay safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Will my player be compared to older kids?</strong> Evaluators consider age, development stage, and safety&mdash;&quot;this is not a single-number ranking exercise.</li>
      </ul>
