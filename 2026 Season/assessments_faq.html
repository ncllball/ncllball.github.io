    <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="left">General</h2>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> Why do we run assessments?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> To build balanced teams and place players where they will develop best. Every player makes a team.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> Who attends?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> All registered AAA/Majors players (baseball and softball). Skilled baseball 9's may attend for AAA consideration; younger divisions do not assess. If you need a refresher on league eligibility rules, see <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768" rel="noopener">Eligibility &amp; Boundaries</a>.</p>
      
      
      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> I think my 9-year-old is pretty good&mdash;can they try out?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> 10's, 11's and 12's fill AAA/Majors first. After 10's, 11's and 12's are placed, skilled 9's can earn spots if roster space remains and their assessment score places them in the draftable pool. If you think your 9-year-old is ready, have them attend; the draftable pool size depends on available roster space after 10's and 11's are placed and, ultimately, how many teams we field. Read the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112136" rel="noopener">AAA Draft Overview</a> to see how teams are formed.</p>
      
      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> Is there a make-up date or what if we miss our window?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> No make-up date is planned. Email <a class="ncll" href="mailto:baseball@ncllball.com?subject=Assessments%202026%20Late%20or%20Missed%20Window">baseball@ncllball.com</a> ASAP if you will be late or must miss. Placement may rely on prior-season evaluations and coach input; late or no-show players may have limited division options.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> What if we arrive late but before the last group begins their stations?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Check in immediately. We will work you into the remaining stations during your sport's window if space allows. The earlier you arrive, the more complete your evaluation.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> What if we arrive late and there are no more groups?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> If the final group of the day has gone, you will not be able to participate. Email <a class="ncll" href="mailto:baseball@ncllball.com?subject=Assessments%202026%20Missed%20Window">baseball@ncllball.com</a> right away. Placement will lean on prior-season evaluations and coach input, which may limit options. We cannot guarantee a live evaluation after the window closes.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> Can parents stay?</h4>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="left">During assessments</h2>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> What skills are evaluated?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Throwing/receiving, infield/outfield reads, hitting (tee/front toss), and baserunning. Pitching/catching may be a separate station.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> How long will it take?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Plan for about 90 minutes in your window. Please arrive early enough for check-in and warm-up.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> How are coaches involved?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Coaches run stations and assess players. If you are a coach and cannot attend, email <a class="ncll" href="mailto:baseball@ncllball.com?subject=Assessments%202026%20Coach%20Coverage">baseball@ncllball.com</a> so coverage is arranged. New to volunteering? Visit the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2117276" rel="noopener">Volunteer Hub</a>.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> Why do players wear bibs?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Bib numbers keep evaluations consistent and impartial. Assessors score the number, not the name, and the draft calculations stay number-based to reduce bias.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> How is scoring handled?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Multiple coaches score each station using the same rubric; scores are combined to form the draft pool and inform placements. See the AAA Draft Overview for how the pool feeds the draft and team assignments.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> What if my player is nervous?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Remind them it's a practice-style workout. Effort, attitude, and listening to cues matter as much as results.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="left">After assessments</h2>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> When are teams formed?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Drafts occur shortly after assessments; families are notified by team staff once rosters are set. See the AAA Draft Overview for how teams are formed and assignments are finalized.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> What if my player is on the bubble?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Final placement depends on scores, roster sizes, and division needs. Younger players may be placed in the best-fit division for development.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question qa-label">Question</span> Can we appeal placement?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer qa-label">Answer</span> Placements are final. If you have a serious concern, email <a class="ncll" href="mailto:baseball@ncllball.com?subject=Assessments%202026%20Placement%20Concern">baseball@ncllball.com</a>.</p>
