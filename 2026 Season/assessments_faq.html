    <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="left">General</h2>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> Why do we run assessments?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> To build balanced teams and place players where they will develop best. Every player makes a team.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> Who attends?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> All registered AAA/Majors players (baseball and softball). Skilled baseball 9's may attend for AAA consideration; younger divisions do not assess.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> I think my 9-year-old is pretty good—can they try out?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> 10's and 11's fill AAA/Majors first. Skilled 9's can earn spots if roster space remains and their assessment score places them in the draftable pool. If you think your 9-year-old is ready, have them attend; the draftable pool size depends on available roster space after 10's and 11's are placed and, ultimately, how many teams we field. Read the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA Draft Overview</a> to see how teams are formed.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> Is there a make-up date or what if we miss our window?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> No make-up date is planned. Email <a class="ncll" href="mailto:baseball@ncllball.com?subject=2026%20Assessments%20Attendance%20Issue">baseball@ncllball.com</a> ASAP if you will be late or must miss. Placement may rely on prior-season evaluations and coach input; late or no-show players may have limited division options.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> What if we arrive late but before the last group begins their stations?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Check in immediately. We will work you into the remaining stations during your sport's window if space allows. The earlier you arrive, the more complete your evaluation.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> What if we arrive late and there are no more groups?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> If the final group of the day has gone, you will not be able to participate. Email <a class="ncll" href="mailto:baseball@ncllball.com?subject=2026%20Assessments%20Missed%20Window">baseball@ncllball.com</a> right away. Placement will lean on prior-season evaluations and coach input, which may limit options. We cannot guarantee a live evaluation after the window closes.</p>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="left">Logistics</h2>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> When and where?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Baseball: Sat, Jan 24 at Robert Eagle Staff MS. Softball: Sat, Feb 7 at Wallingford Boys &amp; Girls Club.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> How do I sign up?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Use the player and volunteer SignUpGenius links on the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112173">Assessments page</a>.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> What should we bring?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Glove, water, weather-appropriate clothing. Helmet (loaners likely available), bat optional. Softball is indoors—wear clean indoor shoes.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> Can parents stay?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Yes, but give coaches and assessors space to run stations. Please keep siblings clear of drill areas.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> How early should we arrive?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Arrive 15–20 minutes before your window for check-in, bibs, and a quick warm-up.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="left">During assessments</h2>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> What skills are evaluated?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Throwing/receiving, infield/outfield reads, hitting (tee/front toss), and baserunning. Pitching/catching may be a separate station.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> How long will it take?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Plan for about 90 minutes in your window. Please arrive early enough for check-in and warm-up.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> How are coaches involved?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Coaches run stations and assess players. If you are a coach and cannot attend, email <a class="ncll" href="mailto:baseball@ncllball.com?subject=2026%20Assessments%20Coach%20Coverage">baseball@ncllball.com</a> so coverage is arranged.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> Why do players wear bibs?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Bib numbers keep evaluations consistent and impartial. Assessors score the number, not the name, and the draft calculations stay number-based to reduce bias.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> How is scoring handled?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Multiple coaches score each station using the same rubric; scores are combined to form the draft pool and inform placements. See the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA Draft Overview</a> for how the pool feeds the draft and team assignments.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> What if my player is nervous?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Remind them it's a practice-style workout. Effort, attitude, and listening to cues matter as much as results.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="left">After assessments</h2>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> When are teams formed?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Drafts occur shortly after assessments; families are notified by team staff once rosters are set. See the <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA Draft Overview</a> for how teams are formed and assignments are finalized.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> What if my player is on the bubble?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Final placement depends on scores, roster sizes, and division needs. Younger players may be placed in the best-fit division for development.</p>

      <h4 class="left"><span class="question">Q:</span> Can we appeal placement?</h4>
      <p><span class="answer">A:</span> Placements are final. If you have a serious concern, email <a class="ncll" href="mailto:baseball@ncllball.com?subject=2026%20Assessments%20Placement%20Concern">baseball@ncllball.com</a>.</p>
