    <p>You canâ€™t have a game without rules. And you canâ€™t have rules without someone to enforce them. We need you to do that for these kids. Itâ€™s the best seat in the house and, along with coaching, the best way to help the youngsters have a great game. And did we mention itâ€™s fun!</p>
    <p>We have veteran umpires who will train you to do as much or as little as you want. Hereâ€™s how to get started and a good place to check in from time to time to get help.</p>
    <h4 class="left">1. Register as a volunteer at the <a class= "ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2117276">Volunteer Hub</a ></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>This allows us to communicate with you and order a background check</li>
        <li>Little League rules require all volunteers to undergo a simple electronic background check. Itâ€™s free and only takes a few minutes to complete the questionnaire.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="left">2. Contact the <a href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2119010" class="ncll">Umpire Coordinator</a></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>They will subscribe you to our Google Group, through which we communicate</li>
        <li>Youâ€™ll receive updates on training and other important information</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="left">Weâ€™ll take it from there! âš¾ðŸŒŸ</h4>
