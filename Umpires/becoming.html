            <p>You can’t have a game without rules, and you can’t have rules without someone to enforce them. Umpiring
                gives you the best seat in the house and, along with coaching, is the most impactful way to help our
                players have a great game. Bonus: it’s a lot of fun.</p>
            <p>Our veteran umpires will train you to do as much or as little as you want. Follow the steps below and
                check back here whenever you need a refresher.</p>
