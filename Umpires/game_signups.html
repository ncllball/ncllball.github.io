        <p>
            Our 2024 Umpire Scheduling system is not yet live. Soon, you'll be able to sign up to umpire baseball and
            softball games through our master schedule right here. For inter-league games, you may be directed to other
            sites.
        </p>

            Signing up in advance is essential for ensuring proper game coverage.
