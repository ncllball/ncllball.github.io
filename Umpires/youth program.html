    <p>NCLL's Youth Umpire Program aims to inspire young individuals, aged 13 to 19, to become umpires. Those who are 14
        or older can earn $30 per game ($40 per game for plate umpires, with approval from the UiC or umpire
        coordinators), or they can opt for community service hours instead.</p>
    <p>If you have any older children, nieces/nephews, neighbors, etc. who might be interested, please encourage them to
        come to the trainings and join Team Blue.</p>
