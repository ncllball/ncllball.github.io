        <h2 class="left">Green Lake's Athletic Fields (Lower Woodland Cloverleaf)</h2>
        <p>Woodland Park's athletic fields, now home to baseball diamonds, have a rich history. Guy C. Phinney, the
            park's
            original owner, laid the groundwork by creating two athletic fields in his private estate during the
            late
            1880s.
            These fields, one in the upper northwest corner and another in the lower southeast, demonstrated his
            commitment
            to recreation. After the City of Seattle acquired the park in 1899, the Olmsted Brothers, in their
            detailed
            1910
            plan, further developed the lower eastern half into athletic fields, including a grandstand at the south
            end.
        </p>
        <p>Changes to Green Lake's shoreline, starting in 1911, significantly impacted the fields. By lowering the
            lake
            level and filling the marshy southern end, a third athletic field was created by 1913. This new field
            was
            intended to replace the older upper field, though that transition wasn't completed until 1929 when the
            upper
            field was integrated into the zoo. The lower fields continued to evolve, with a second grandstand added
            in
            1915
            and a shelter house with dressing rooms and showers built in 1929. Today, those fields, transformed into
            baseball diamonds, stand as a testament to the park's long-standing dedication to sports and recreation.

        <p>I'm fascinated by the history of these fields and the teams (North Central I assume) that played on them.
            Our
            years on the board and volunteering&mdash;not unlike yours as parents in the league&mdash;are fleeting.
            I can
            definitely see how things get lost in the shuffle of volunteers and parents constantly and
            unrelentingly
            churning through. </p>
        <p>That said, there are quite a few of us who would love to hear any stories or see any media related to
            NCLL
            from
            back in the day. If you have anything, hit us up at <a href="mailto:treasurer@ncllball.com"
