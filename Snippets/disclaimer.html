<p>Although proof of residency or school attendance is not explicitly required for 2025 Registration by Little League, NCLL requires players entering the league for the first time with no history in NCLL from an address outside of its boundary -- who does NOT attend an NCLL eligible school -- to obtain a waiver in order to play for NCLL. Players who receive a waiver to play for NCLL will not be eligible to participate in post-season tournaments.</p>
