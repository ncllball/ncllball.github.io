      <h3 class="left">GameChanger vs. Team Central — what’s the difference?</h3>
      <p>
        GameChanger is your team’s day‑to‑day app: live scoring, chat, roster, and notifications. Team Central (Sports Connect)
        is the league portal: official schedules, standings, and team pages. Many teams use both — follow Team Central for the official
        schedule, use GameChanger for live updates and communication
