        <h4 class="left">Question:</h4>
        <p>
            Recently, a situation arose where the usual scorekeepers were unavailable, and an alternative person had to
            score the game. This led to complications as the players were not visible in the app, necessitating a manual
            lineup setup. Consequently, this resulted in duplicate player entries and incorrect statistics within the
            app. The primary concern now is whether there is a method to merge these duplicate players and ensure the
            correct games are reflected in the schedule.

            The issue of duplicate players typically arises when the lineup isn't properly set, and another team handles
            the scorekeeping. This can lead to discrepancies in player data. Although there is no direct way to merge
            players, deleting duplicates is possible. Generally, the second listing of a player is the duplicate. To
            verify, you can click on the player and check their contacts tab; if it's blank, it's the correct one to
            delete. If editing the box score doesn't resolve the stats issue, rescoring the game might be necessary.
            This involves taking screenshots of the play-by-play tab and marking defensive positions for each inning,
            using a paper scorebook or game video for verification.

            If you are a league admin, you have the capability to open the scoring for the game in the app. After
            gathering all necessary backup data, you can hit the undo button until you return to the start of the game.
            This allows you to set the rosters correctly and re-enter the game data. If you aren't a league admin, you
            can still manage the situation by starting to score the game as if nothing happened. Once completed, the
            league admin can decide which scorebook to use for the league's stats and results.
