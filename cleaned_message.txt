Wow, this is exciting! Here's what I'm thinking:

1. Do we want to set up a Google Chat space? I know David's not a huge fan, but since we're rolling out Google Chat to coaches this year, it'd look weird to splinter off to Slack right now—especially since the whole point of adopting Google for the NP was to centralize our assets and data. Plus, Slack costs a bit (not terrible, but still).

2. On the IDE front—I'm curious what you're thinking so I can get up to speed. I've got three OpenAI seats I can put into action (technically unlimited with a cost, but I chose three for the work I'm doing). GitHub would be really solid, I think. I use it with VS Code, but even the web interface could work great for us. Give me a few days and I can dive down the GitHub AI rabbit hole, figure out the offerings, and walk you guys through it. I can have whatever number of logins we need all set up in the same org, etc. But I'm open to other ideas too.

3. If you guys want to just keep moving in your current workflow without any of the above, that's totally fine. We can get it done and then figure out better ways to integrate everything as we go.

4. Yearly projections and first 30-day comparison—I think the highlighted text nails it.
