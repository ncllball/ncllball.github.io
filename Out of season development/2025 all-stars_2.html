        <h2 class="left">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h4 class="left">Q: What if my child cannot make the scheduled tryout date?</h4>
        <p>A: For Baseball, attendance is highly recommended but not mandatory. For Softball, please contact Gayle Perez
            regarding assessments. Coaches evaluate players throughout the season, including their performance in games,
            practices, and overall attitude. Tryout attendance is just one factor in the selection process, and missing
            the tryout does not automatically disqualify a player from being considered for the team.</p>

        <h4 class="left">Q: What does "availability for the District Tournament is a requirement" mean?</h4>
        <p>A: It means your child must be able to attend all scheduled games during the District 8 tournament for their
            age group. If you have unavoidable conflicts during this period, you should discuss this prior to accepting
            a roster spot, or it may impact selection, as consistent team presence is crucial for All-Stars.</p>
