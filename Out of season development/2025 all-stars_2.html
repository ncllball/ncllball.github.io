    <h2>7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <h3>Q: What if my child cannot make the scheduled tryout date?</h3>
    <p>A: For Baseball, attendance is highly recommended but not mandatory. For Softball, please contact Gayle Perez regarding assessments. Coaches evaluate players throughout the season, so tryout attendance is just one factor in the selection process.</p>

    <h3>Q: What does "availability for the District Tournament is a requirement" mean?</h3>
    <p>A: It means your child must be able to attend all scheduled games during the District 8 tournament for their age group. If you have unavoidable conflicts during this period, you should discuss this prior to accepting a roster spot, or it may impact selection, as consistent team presence is crucial for All-Stars.</p>

    <h3>Q: Who should I contact with questions?</h3>
    <p>A: For general All-Star questions not answered here, or for application submission issues, please use the primary application email addresses listed above.
