				<span>This year's registration is more aggressive in asking for proof of eligibility, but please note: <strong>It is NOT REQUIRED by NCLL&mdash;this is a Little League International question and does not need to be answered in order for a successful registration.</strong> We will ask for this paperwork if your player makes All-Stars.</span>

			<p>You only need <strong>one</strong> eligibility path&mdash;either <span class="ncll-italic-accent">residency</span> or <span class="ncll-italic-accent">school enrollment</span>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Players enrolled at schools located inside the NCLL boundary are also eligible, even if they live outside it.</li>
				<li>If your school is missing from the list below, choose “Other” during registration and type the school name. This helps us capture boundary adjustments and confirm eligibility.</li>
				<li>Preschools do not affect eligibility. T-ball registration is open regardless of school or residence—feel free to note your preschool for placement purposes only.</li>
