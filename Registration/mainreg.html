                North Central Little League (NCLL) is in Washington's<a class="ncll"

                    District 8 </a>and covers areas including
                Wallingford, Greenlake, Fremont, Phinney Ridge, Greenwood, and Ballard.
            </li>
            <li>
                To play for NCLL, your player must either live within <a class="ncll"
                    href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768">NCLL boundaries</a> or attend an <a class="ncll"
                    href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768">eligible school</a> within those
                boundaries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Although proof of residency or school attendance is not explicitly required for 2025 Registration by
                Little
                League, NCLL requires players new to the league (no prior history) who do not reside within the league's
                boundary or attend an eligible school within the boundary to obtain a waiver in order to play for NCLL.
                Players
                in receipt of this type of waiver are not eligible to participate in post-season tournaments.
            </li>
            <li>
                For waiver information, please reach out to NCLL's

            Step 2: Determine the Appropriate Division for Your Player
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the registration process, you'll need to indicate the division for which you're registering. To make
            this
            decision, first determine your player's "league age":
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>League Age:</span> In Little League, ‚Äúleague age‚Äù refers to the age a player will be on August 31
                <super>st</super>
                (Baseball) and December 31<super>st</super> (Softball) of the current year.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Baseball Example:</span> If a player will be 9 years old on August 31<super>st</super>, 2025, they
                are considered ‚Äúleague
                age 9‚Äù for the 2025 season.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Softball Example:</span> If a player will be 9 years old on December 31<super>st</super>, 2025,
                they are considered "league
                age 9" for the 2025 softball season. Note that softball uses December 31<super>st</super> as the cutoff
                date, which differs from
                baseball's August 31<super>st</super> cutoff. League age may be different from a player's actual age
                during the season.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Use the
            <a class="ncll" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114734">league age/division eligibility</a> to
            determine which division(s) your player is eligible for based on their league age.

            <li>
                All players wishing to participate in AAA, Majors, or Junior divisions must attend

                division.

            <li>Players will be notified of assessment dates, times, and locations via email.</li>
            <li>
                The Player Agent will conduct the assessments and make recommendations based on the players' skills and

                <span>Requesting Higher Division:</span>
                You may request for your player to participate in a division higher than their eligibility. This request
                will be
                reviewed and approved only if appropriate. Factors considered include safety, previous coach feedback,
                team
                composition, and division balance.

            team,
            regardless of their assessment results. The assessments are used to ensure that players are placed in
            divisions
            where they can develop their skills and have a positive playing experience.

                                Participation for 9's depends on roster spots after placing 12's, 11's, and

                                Majors, 10's AAA or above, and 11's are split between Majors and AAA. If
                                space allows,
                                assessment scores determine 9's eligibility for the AAA draft, finalized by
