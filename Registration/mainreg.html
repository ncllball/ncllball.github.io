        <ul>
            <li>
                North Central Little League (NCLL) is in Washington's
                <a class="ncll" href="https://www.llwadistrict8.org/"> District 8 </a>and covers areas including Wallingford,
                Greenlake, Fremont, Phinney
                Ridge, Greenwood, and Ballard
            </li>
            <li>
                To play for NCLL, your player must either live within
                <a class="ncll" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768">NCLL boundaries</a>
                or attend an
                <a class="ncll" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768">eligible school</a>
                within those boundaries
            </li>
            <li>
                Although proof of residency or school attendance is not explicitly
                required for 2026 Registration by Little League, NCLL requires players
                new to the league (no prior history) who do not reside within the
                league's boundary or attend an eligible school within the boundary to
                obtain a waiver in order to play for NCLL. Players in receipt of this
                type of waiver are not eligible to participate in post-season
                tournaments.
            </li>
            <li>
                For waiver information, please reach out to NCLL's
                <a class="ncll" href="mailto:president@ncllball.com"> president </a>who will assist in the waiver process.

            Step 2: Determine the Appropriate Division for Your Player
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the registration process, you'll need to indicate the division
            for which you're registering. To make this decision, first determine
            your player's "league age":
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>League Age:</span> In Little League, ‚Äúleague age‚Äù refers to the
                age a player will be on August 31
                <sup>st</sup>
                (Baseball) and December 31<sup>st</sup> (Softball) of the current year
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Baseball Example:</span> If a player will be 9 years old on
                August 31<sup>st</sup>, 2026, they are considered ‚Äúleague age 9‚Äù for
                the 2026 season
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Softball Example:</span> If a player will be 9 years old on
                December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2026, they are considered "league age 9" for
                the 2026 softball season. Note that softball uses December 31<sup>st</sup>
                as the cutoff date, which differs from baseball's August 31<sup>st</sup>
                cutoff. League age may be different from a player's actual age during
                the season.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Use the league age chart and calculator below in Step 2(a) to help
            determine your players 'league age'.

            <li>
                The purpose of these assessments is to evaluate players' abilities and
                ensure competitive balance
            </li>
            <li>
                Players will be notified of assessment dates, times, and locations via

                You may request for your player to participate in a division higher
                than their eligibility. This request will be reviewed and approved
                only if appropriate. Factors considered include safety, previous coach

            It is important to note that assessments are not tryouts. All players
            will be placed on a team, regardless of their assessment results. The
            assessments are used to ensure that players are placed in divisions
            where they can develop their skills and have a positive playing
            experience.

                    <span><u>Note</u>: All kids play T-ball. Baseball is open to boys

                    for girls only, starting from A Division.</span>

                <p>
                    <sup>1</sup>T-ball (5-6) is for 5's/6's and less
                    skilled/interested 7's; 6's with a year of T-ball should
                    consider coach-pitch (A Baseball).

                <p>
                    <sup>2</sup>Kindergarten Coach Pitch (6-7) is for kids who can
                    hit pitches but may need the tee. Only 6+ can join, per Little
                    League rules, using the T-ball field.

                <p>
                    <sup>3</sup>Baseball A (7-8) (Kid-Pitch/Coach-Pitch Blend) is for 7's/8's, but 6's with a

                <p>
                    <sup>5</sup>Baseball AAA (9-11) is for 9's to 11's and rarely,
                    highly-skilled 8's. Participation for 9's depends on roster
                    spots after placing 12's, 11's, and 10's. 12's must play
                    Majors, 10's AAA or above, and 11's are split between Majors
                    and AAA. If space allows, assessment scores determine 9's
                    eligibility for the AAA draft, finalized by late January (see
                    <a href="#assessments">Assessments</a>
                    for details); 12's can play down with a safety waiver.

                <p>
                    <sup>6</sup>Baseball Majors (10-12) is mainly for 11's and
                    12's, with a few highly-skilled 10's. 9's are eligible but
                    it's rare.

                <p>
                    <sup>7</sup>Baseball Juniors (13-14) is for 13's &amp; 14's.
                    While 12's can join, it's not advised as they'd forego a year
                    of Majors.

                <p>

                    16's, though as young as 13's are eligible.
