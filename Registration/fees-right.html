        <li>Field use, permits, maintenance materials (chalk, bases, mound clay)</li>
        <li>League-supplied uniforms (shirts / caps — plus AAA/Major hoodie upgrade, see note below)</li>
        <li>Shared equipment (catcher’s gear, tees, practice balls, first aid kits)</li>
        <li>Umpire training / game fees (where applicable)</li>
        <li>Background checks & required safety training for volunteers</li>
