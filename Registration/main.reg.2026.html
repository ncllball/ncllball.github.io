      Step 1: Determine Eligibility for NCLL
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="stickout_1">This year's registration is more aggressive in asking for proof of eligibility, but please note: It is NOT REQUIRED by NCLL&mdash;this is a Little League International question and does not need to be answered in order for a successful registration. We will ask for this paperwork if your player makes All-stars.</li>

          NCLL is in Washington's

          and covers Wallingford, Greenlake, Fremont, Phinney Ridge, Greenwood,
          and Ballard
        </li>
      <li>
          Players must live within

          New players outside boundaries need a waiver to play; for that and all

    <ul>
      <li>
          <span class="stickout_1">League Age</span> is your player's age on

      <li>
          League Age is not the same as chronological age (the age they are on
          their birthday)

      <p>
          <span class="footies-note">Note:</span> All kids play T-ball.
          Baseball is open to boys and girls. Softball divisions are
          gender-specific and are for girls only, starting from A Division.
        </p>
      <p>
          <sup>1</sup><span class="footies-intro">T-ball (5-6)</span> is for 5's/6's and less skilled/interested
          7's; 6's with a year of T-ball should consider coach-pitch (A
          Baseball).
        </p>
      <p>
          <sup>2</sup><span class="footies-intro">Kindergarten Coach Pitch (6-7)</span> is for kids who can hit
          pitches but may need the tee. Only 6+ can join, per Little League
          rules, using the T-ball field.
        </p>
      <p>
          <sup>3</sup><span class="footies-intro">Baseball A</span> uses a kid-pitch/coach-pitch blend and is for 7's/8's, but 6's with a year of T-ball are encouraged to register.
        </p>
      <p>
          <sup>4</sup><span class="footies-intro">Baseball AA (8-9)</span> is mainly for 8's/9's, though some
          skilled 7-year-olds played last year.
        </p>
      <p>
          <sup>5</sup><span class="footies-intro">Baseball AAA (9-11)</span> is for 9's to 11's and rarely,
          highly-skilled 8's. Participation for 9's depends on roster spots
          after placing 12's, 11's, and 10's. 12's must play Majors, 10's AAA
          or above, and 11's are split between Majors and AAA. If space
          allows, assessment scores determine 9's eligibility for the AAA
          draft, finalized by late January (see
          <a href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112173">Assessments</a>
          for details); 12's can play down with a safety waiver.
        </p>
      <p>
          <sup>6</sup><span class="footies-intro">Baseball Majors (10-12)</span> is mainly for 11's and 12's,
          with a few highly-skilled 10's. 9's are eligible but it's rare.
        </p>
      <p>
          <sup>7</sup><span class="footies-intro">Baseball Juniors (13-14)</span> is for 13's &amp; 14's. While
          12's can join, it's not advised as they'd forego a year of Majors.
        </p>
      <p>
          <sup>8</sup><span class="footies-intro">Baseball Seniors (15-16)</span> is mainly for 15's &amp; 16's,
          though as young as 13's are eligible.
