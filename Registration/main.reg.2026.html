            </li>
            <li>
                Players must live within <a class="ncll" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768">NCLL boundaries</a>

            </li>
            <li>
                New players outside boundaries need a waiver to play; for that and all waiver matters, please contact

                <p>
                    <span class="footies_note">Note:</span> All kids play T-ball. Baseball is open to boys
                    and girls. Softball divisions are gender-specific and are
                    for girls only, starting from A Division.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <sup>1</sup>T-ball (5-6) is for 5's/6's and less
                    skilled/interested 7's; 6's with a year of T-ball should
                    consider coach-pitch (A Baseball).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <sup>2</sup>Kindergarten Coach Pitch (6-7) is for kids who can
                    hit pitches but may need the tee. Only 6+ can join, per Little
                    League rules, using the T-ball field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <sup>3</sup>Baseball A (7-8) (Kid-Pitch/Coach-Pitch Blend) is for 7's/8's, but 6's with a
                    year of T-ball are encouraged to register.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <sup>4</sup>Baseball AA (8-9) is mainly for 8's/9's, though
                    some skilled 7-year-olds played last year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <sup>5</sup>Baseball AAA (9-11) is for 9's to 11's and rarely,
                    highly-skilled 8's. Participation for 9's depends on roster
                    spots after placing 12's, 11's, and 10's. 12's must play
                    Majors, 10's AAA or above, and 11's are split between Majors
                    and AAA. If space allows, assessment scores determine 9's
                    eligibility for the AAA draft, finalized by late January (see
                    <a href="#assessments">Assessments</a>
                    for details); 12's can play down with a safety waiver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <sup>6</sup>Baseball Majors (10-12) is mainly for 11's and
                    12's, with a few highly-skilled 10's. 9's are eligible but
                    it's rare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <sup>7</sup>Baseball Juniors (13-14) is for 13's &amp; 14's.
                    While 12's can join, it's not advised as they'd forego a year
                    of Majors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <sup>8</sup>Baseball Seniors (15-16) is mainly for 15's &amp;
                    16's, though as young as 13's are eligible.
