<!-- Step 1: Determine Eligibility for NCLL -->
<h2>
  Step 1: Determine Eligibility for NCLL
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    North Central Little League (NCLL) is in Washington's <a class="ncll divlinks" href="https://www.llwadistrict8.org/">
      District 8
    </a> and covers areas including Wallingford, Greenlake, Fremont, Phinney Ridge, Greenwood, and Ballard.
  </li>
  <li>
    To play for NCLL, your player must either live within NCLL boundaries or attend a school within those boundaries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check the <a class="ncll divlinks" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768">League Boundaries</a> page for details and a list of <a class="ncll divlinks" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114768">eligible schools</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    While proof of residency or school attendance is not required during registration, players outside our boundary will need a waiver to play for NCLL. Note that such players won‚Äôt be eligible for post-season tournaments.
  </li>
  <li>
    For waiver information, please contact our <a class="ncll divlinks" href="mailto:registrar@ncllball.com">

<!-- Step 2: Determine the Appropriate Division for Your Player -->
<h2>
  Step 2: Determine the Appropriate Division for Your Player
</h2>
<p>
  During the registration process, you'll need to indicate the division for which you're registering. To make this decision, first determine your player's "league age":
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>League Age:</span> In Little League, ‚Äúleague age‚Äù refers to the age a player will be on August 31 (Baseball) and December 31 (Softball) of the current year. It is used to determine a player‚Äôs eligibility for a particular division. Here‚Äôs how it works:
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Baseball Example:</span> If a player will be 9 years old on August 31, 2025, they are considered ‚Äúleague age 9‚Äù for the 2025 season.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Softball Example:</span> If a player will be 9 years old on December 31, 2025, they are considered ‚Äúleague age 9‚Äù for the 2025 season. (Softball uses different dates). League age is not the same as chronological age (the age they are on their birthday).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Use the <span><a class="ncll divlinks" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2114734">league age/division eligibility</a></span> to determine which division(s) your player is eligible for based on their league age.
</p>

<!-- Assessments -->
<h3>Assessments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    All players wishing to participate in AAA, Majors, or Junior divisions must attend <a class="ncll divlinks" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2112173">assessments</a>, regardless of their previous division.
  </li>
  <li>
    The purpose of these assessments is to evaluate players' abilities and ensure competitive balance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Players will be notified of assessment dates, times, and locations via email.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Player Agent will conduct the assessments and make recommendations based on the players' skills and abilities.
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Team Assignments -->
<h3>Team Assignments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    After registration, division placement, and assessments, your player will be assigned to a team.
  </li>
  <li>
    All players will be placed on a team.
  </li>
  <li>
    Team <a class="ncll divlinks" href="/Default.aspx?tabid=2112136">assignments</a> are typically finalized by late February, with adjustments made as necessary to maintain balance and accommodate late registrations.
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Special Cases -->
<h3>Special Cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>Requesting Higher Division:</span>
    You may request for your player to participate in a division higher than their eligibility. This request will be reviewed and approved only if appropriate. Factors considered include safety, previous coach feedback, team composition, and division balance.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span>Note:</span> It is important to note that assessments are not tryouts. All players will be placed on a team, regardless of their assessment results. The assessments are used to ensure that players are placed in divisions where they can develop their skills and have a positive playing experience.
