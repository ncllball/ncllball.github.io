Each year, NCLL grants a number of full and partial scholarships to families. Please complete the <a class="ncll" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5JIcH7zLuLGVLSBSXHIOhbOtgYmP8rkW5w86_wB36zEbuoQ/viewform">Financial Aid form</a> prior to registration to let us know what type(s) of scholarship you need.</p><p> Once approved, our Registrar will contact you with a promotional code to be entered into the shopping cart when completing the registration process.</p>
    Although proof of residency or school attendance is not explicitly required for 2025 Registration by Little League, NCLL requires players entering the league for the first time with no history in NCLL from an address outside of its boundary -- who does NOT attend an NCLL eligible school -- to obtain a waiver in order to play for NCLL. Players who receive a waiver to play for NCLL will not be eligible to participate in post-season tournaments.
