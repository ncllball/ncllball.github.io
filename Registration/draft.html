    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <p>Team formation is always an important and robust discussion topic amongst our Board, coaches, and families. For 2024,
            we made the decision to form AAA teams via a draft. We wanted to inform our parents how we made that decision, why
            it was made, and the benefits we believe will make NCLL even stronger.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Background Section -->
    <section id="background">
        <p>First, we looked at our own history. Prior to COVID, AAA formed teams via draft just like we do in Majors. However,
            our re-emergence into social situations brought with it many challenges for us to think over. We also wanted to be
            close to those we hadn't seen in a while. Team formation reflected those priorities.</p>
        <p>Second, we talked with other leagues in the area. We found we were the lone league not forming AAA teams via a draft.
            Some leagues even use a draft for AA, with admittedly more social engineering built in. Next we looked at the
            benefits of a draft:</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Benefits Section -->
    <section id="benefits">
        <h4 id="1-greater-team-parity" class="left">Greater team parity</h4>
        <p>A team that shows up and wins with little effort is not learning crucial skills that Little League teaches. Likewise,
            when a team struggles, they fail to learn skills and we also know that leads to a quick exit from the sport.</p>

        <h4 id="2-different-experiences" class="left">Different experiences</h4>
        <p>Kids get to experience the different styles of different coaching staffs. We have many different coaches who all have
            different styles, ways of communicating, and philosophies. The kids will get to experience these differences and
            better understand the best environment for them in the future.</p>

        <h4 id="3-kids-get-to-know-other-kids" class="left">Kids get to know other kids</h4>
        <p>We are a community driven league, so we think the community benefits from getting to know one another -- not
            remaining in our school, work, or neighborhood silos.</p>

        <h4 id="4-transparency" class="left">Transparency</h4>
        <a href="https://dt5602vnjxv0c.cloudfront.net/portals/83437/images/pxl_20240203_185848472.jpg" target="_blank">

                class="thumbnail images" alt="Draft Process Image">
        </a>
        <p>Finally, a draft provides transparency for coaches to feel a sense of fairness and and most importantly, parents are
            able to see our process and better understand the outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Draft Rules Section -->
    <section id="draft-rules">
        <p>Following these evaluations, we voted to move forward with a draft for AAA, adopting many of the same rules from
            Majors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draft&nbsp;order drawn from hat at the beginning of the&nbsp;draft.</li>
            <li>All returning majors players, and 12-year-olds new to majors, are picked in the first stage of the&nbsp;draft.</li>
            <li>Players under 12 who are new to majors are picked next, this stage starts after all players required to play
                majors are selected.</li>
            <li>We do allow coaching pairings, but the number per team is capped.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Returning Players that come with coaches are automatically selected in the first round(s).</li>
            <li>New players that come with coaches are automatically selected in the beginning of the second stage of
                the&nbsp;draft.</li>
            <li>Following the draft, coaches are empowered to complete trades to better align kids socially, where possible,
                without materially affecting either team.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section id="conclusion">
        <p>We see it as a success and are happy with how the teams turned out, believing we found a sweet spot between
            competitiveness and social, and we will be a better division and league because of it. Check out the following
            pictures from the actual draft!</p>
