    <h2 class="left">Why we draft for AAA/Majors</h2>

    <section>
        <p>Team formation is always an important and robust discussion topic amongst our Board, coaches, and families.
            For 2024,
            we made the decision to form AAA teams via a draft. This was the process that led to that
            decision, why
            it was made, and the benefits we believe will make NCLL even stronger.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Background Section -->
    <section>
        <p>First, we looked at our own history. Prior to COVID, AAA formed teams via draft just like we do in Majors.
            However,
            our re-emergence into social situations brought with it many challenges for us to think over. We also wanted
            to be
            close to those we hadn't seen in a while. Team formation reflected those priorities.</p>
        <p>Second, we talked with other leagues in the area. We found we were the lone league not forming AAA teams via
            a draft.
            Some leagues even use a draft for AA, with admittedly more social engineering built in. Next we looked at
            the
            benefits of a draft:</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Benefits Section -->
    <section>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Competitive balance:</strong> A draft evens out talent across teams, leading to more competitive
                games
                and a better experience for all players.</li>

            <li><strong>Different experiences:</strong> Kids experience the diverse styles, communication approaches,
                and philosophies of our many coaching staffs to better understand the environment that fits them best.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Social:</strong> As a community driven league, we think the community benefits from getting to
                know one another -- not
                remaining in our school, work, or neighborhood silos.</li>


            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Finally, a draft provides transparency for coaches to feel a sense of
                fairness and and most importantly,
                parents are
                able to see our process and better understand the outcomes.</li>
    </section>

    <!-- Draft Rules Section -->
    <section>
        <p>Following these evaluations, we voted to move forward with a draft for AAA, adopting many of the same rules
            from
            Majors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draft order drawn from a hat</li>
            <li>First stage: returning Majors players and new 12‑year‑olds</li>
            <li>Second stage: under‑12 players new to Majors</li>
            <li>Coaching pairings allowed (capped per team)</li>
            <li>Players linked to coaches selected early in each stage</li>
            <li>Post‑draft trades allowed to align socially without changing team balance</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
        <p>We see it as a success and are happy with how the teams turned out, believing we found a sweet spot between
            competitiveness and social, and we will be a better division and league because of it. Check out the
            following
            pictures from the actual draft!</p>
