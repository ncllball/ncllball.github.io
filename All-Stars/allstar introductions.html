    <section id="introduction">
        <p>Each year, North Central Little League (NCLL) sponsors several teams to compete in the Little League District
            8 Tournament. The All-Stars teams represent our league and may have the opportunity to advance to the state
            tournament.</p>
        <p>Let this space be both an introduction to those players and teams and a place to celebrate their accomplishments. This landing page will introduce future teams while the pages that follow will commemorate past teams.</p>
