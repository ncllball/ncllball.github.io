<h2 class="left">Hello North Central Little League families and friends!</h2>

<p>Over the last couple of years, some of NCLL's long time community members and volunteers had advocated for designing
    and adopting a new logo with an identity unique to NCLL. We needed something inclusive of baseball and softball, and
    we wanted it to represent a place we all know so well.</p>
<p><span>The Cloverleaf at Lower Woodland, NCLL's home fields.</span></p>
<p>As players grow up from Tee Ball through Single-A to Double-AA, the Cloverleaf becomes the "show" they can't wait to play
    at. We have spent countless evenings and weekends there to support our players in one way or another, from cheering
    from the bleachers to coaching and umpiring on the field. It is a special place we all love and will all be able to
    easily identify in our new logo. We can’t wait to start seeing it worn with pride wherever we go!</p>
