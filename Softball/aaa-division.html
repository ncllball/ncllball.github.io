    <title>AAA Softball Division Rules of Play</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <p>Welcome to the AAA (Minor) Division of our Little League softball program! As a Double Goal League, we
            emphasize both <em>player development</em> and <em>competitive success</em>. These guidelines supplement the
            Little League International ("Green Book") Softball Rules and highlight local points of emphasis for our
            league. When not otherwise specified below, official Little League Softball rules govern play.</p>
        <p>This level is often a player's first full season of player pitch. The overarching goals are learning proper
            softball fundamentals, building confidence, encouraging participation in multiple defensive positions, and
            fostering love of the game while introducing situational awareness and strategy.</p>

    <!-- Pitching Section -->
    <section id="pitching">
        <h2 id="pitching" class="left">Pitching</h2>
        <h4 id="who-pitches" class="left">Who Pitches</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Any rostered player may pitch if they demonstrate safe mechanics in practice</li>
            <li>Encourage multiple pitchers; development outweighs short‑term game outcome at this level</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="pitching-distance" class="left">Pitching Distance</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The pitching rubber is set at 35 feet from the back point of home plate (Little League Softball Minor / AAA standard)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="pitching-limits" class="left">Pitching Limits & Rest</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Little League Softball uses <strong>innings pitched</strong> guidelines rather than pitch counts (unlike baseball)</li>
            <li>Managers should monitor fatigue: loss of control, dropping elbow, slowing arm circle, or decreased velocity are signs to remove a pitcher</li>
            <li>Rotate pitchers early in the season so more players gain circle experience before playoffs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="pitching-mechanics" class="left">Mechanics & Instruction</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stress a smooth arm circle, consistent stride, and safe follow‑through (avoiding abrupt shoulder recoil)</li>
            <li>Focus on command (strikes) before movement pitches—no riseballs, drops, or curves are required at this level</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="hit-by-pitch" class="left">Hit By Pitch</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If a batter is hit by a legal pitch, they are awarded first base; encourage batters not to bail early and to turn away properly</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="catcher-pitcher-usage" class="left">Catcher / Pitcher Usage</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To reduce overuse, avoid having the same player catch a full game and then pitch significant innings in the same day where possible</li>
            <li>Warm‑up tosses between innings should be limited—use a backup player to start the inning if the pitcher is not ready</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="illegal-pitch" class="left">Illegal Pitch</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Umpires will call obvious illegal pitches (crow hopping, replanting). Early in the season, most violations are handled as instructional warnings unless they create advantage</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Hitting Section -->
    <section id="hitting">
        <h2 id="hitting" class="left">Hitting</h2>
        <h4 id="balls-and-strikes" class="left">Balls and Strikes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard softball count applies (4 balls / 3 strikes)</li>
            <li>Foul balls with two strikes keep the batter alive (including tipped foul balls not securely caught)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="batting-order" class="left">Batting Order</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous (straight) lineup—every player bats in order, regardless of defensive participation that inning</li>
            <li>Players arriving late are added to the bottom of the order without penalty</li>
            <li>If a player cannot continue due to injury or illness, their spot is skipped (no automatic out)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="throwing-bats" class="left">Throwing Bats</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>One warning per team for an accidentally thrown bat; subsequent occurrences may result in the batter being declared out for safety</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="offensive-coaching" class="left">Offensive Coaching Focus</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Prioritize timing, balanced stance, tracking the ball, and running hard out of the box</li>
            <li>Bunting is optional—use it sparingly, focusing first on core swing development</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Base Running Section -->
    <section id="base-running">
        <h2 id="base-running" class="left">Base Running</h2>
        <h4 id="leadoffs" class="left">Leaving the Base</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Runners may leave the base when the pitcher releases the ball (softball rule difference from baseball AAA)</li>
            <li>Leaving early results in the runner being returned (warning) or called out after repeated violations</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="stealing" class="left">Stealing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stealing of 2B and 3B is permitted once the ball is released</li>
            <li>Advancing home on a passed ball / wild pitch / overthrow is permitted unless a local pre‑season notice states otherwise (Managers will be informed if a temporary restriction applies early in the year)</li>
            <li>No delayed steal attempts prior to release—movement must begin after, not during the circle motion</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="sliding" class="left">Sliding</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sliding feet‑first is encouraged on close plays</li>
            <li>Head‑first slides while advancing are not allowed; head‑first return to a base is permitted</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="overthrows" class="left">Overthrows / Live Ball</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ball remains live on overthrows unless it enters dead‑ball territory (then standard base awards apply)</li>
            <li>Teach runners to listen to base coaches and pick up the next base decisively</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="base-coaches" class="left">Base Coaches</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use both 1B and 3B coaches—consider trained parents if rostered staff is limited</li>
            <li>Coaches should focus on clear, calm, early instructions ("hold", "round", "get down")</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Fielding Section -->
    <section id="fielding">
        <h2 id="fielding" class="left">Fielding</h2>

            <li>No 4th outfielder—focus on teaching traditional coverage responsibilities</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="rotations" class="left">Rotations & Minimum Play</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Every player must have at least one infield and one outfield defensive opportunity during a regulation game when feasible</li>
            <li>Strive to distribute innings (avoid one player locked at a single non‑battery position all game unless for safety)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="development-focus" class="left">Development Focus</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Repetition on fundamental plays: force at 1B, throwing to correct base, backing up, communication on pop‑ups</li>
            <li>Introduce cut‑off structure late season (SS for LF/CF, 2B for RF) but keep it simple—limit advanced relays early on</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Umpire Section -->
    <section id="umpire">
        <h2 id="umpire" class="left">Umpire</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The league assigns a plate umpire for regular season games whenever available</li>
            <li>If absent at game time, the home team supplies a qualified adult; managers mutually agree if calls will be made from behind the plate or behind the pitcher (safety permitting)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="additional-umpire" class="left">Additional Umpire</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>During playoffs or interleague matchups, a second (base) umpire may be provided</li>
            <li>The plate umpire has final authority on rules interpretations</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
