<h4 class="left"><strong>*</strong>Notes on Days of the Week</h4>
<p>The scheduled days of softball events is listed under each division. This schedule was established long before our
    time and is agreed upon by all leagues in <a class="ncll" href="https://www.llwadistrict8.org/">District 8</a>.
    Although occasional tweaks are made, they are always in coordination with the district. </p>
<p>For instance, if Majors play on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at the district level, we must schedule our Majors
    games on those days.</p>
<p>As a result, requests such as, "I would like to coach but can only make it on..." are nearly impossible to
    accommodate and largely out of our hands.</p>
<h4 class="left"><strong>*</strong>Notes on Practice Days</h4>
<p>Practice days will make every effort to match the days of the week games will be scheduled, however
    this is a goal, not a guarantee</p>
