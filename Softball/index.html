            <h2 class="left">Find the right division for your player</h2>
            <p>North Central Little League offers softball divisions for players ages 6-14, from first-time players learning the basics to competitive teams preparing for high school ball. Softball is designated for girls. Each division is designed to match players' developmental stages with appropriate skill challenges and game formats.</p>

            <p><strong>How to choose:</strong> Divisions are primarily based on your child's league age (their age on August 31<sup>st</sup>). Hover over any division card below to see full details about practice schedules, field locations, and what makes each division unique. If you're unsure which division is right, contact our registrar for guidance.</p>

            <p>Registration for all divisions opens in early January. Assessments for AAA and Majors divisions typically occur in late February.</p>

            <p>If you believe your player is capable of playing at a higher division than initially offered, indicate this during the registration process. This will be decided at <a class="ncll" href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2112173">assessments (AAA & Majors)</a>, so please sign up and plan on attending.</p>

            <p><strong>Note for coaches:</strong> If you need more detailed information than what's provided here — such as specific rules, draft procedures, or coaching resources — you're probably a coach! Head over to our <a href="../Coaching/index.html" class="ncll">Coaching section</a> for comprehensive guides, training materials, and division-specific coaching information.</p>

This schedule was established long before our time and is agreed upon by all leagues in District 8. Although occasional tweaks are made, they are always in coordination with the district. For instance, if Majors play on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at the district level, we must schedule our Majors games on those days. As a result, requests such as, "I would like to coach but can only make it on..." are nearly impossible to accommodate and largely out of our hands.</p>
