				<p>NCLL sits at the intersection of community history, Lower Woodland's Cloverleaf fields, and generations of volunteers dedicated to helping kids fall in love with baseball and softball.</p>

				<p>The Cloverleaf at Lower Woodland is more than a cluster of diamonds—it is the main stage for every North Central player. As kids move from Tee to Teen, the bleachers swell with families, coaches pour countless hours into practices, and the soundtrack of the season echoes across those fields.</p>
				<p>Because that space is woven into our identity, we refreshed the NCLL badge and, in the spring 2025 brand refresh, introduced the new clover mark to lean fully into its shape and energy. Spotting the clover on gear or uniforms now feels like carrying a piece of the Lower Woodland home fields wherever you go. Explore the full details on our <a class="ncll" href="/About us/logo.html">logo refresh page</a>.</p>

				<img alt="Historic view of Green Lake athletic fields" class="thumbnail media-float-right" src="https://ncllball.github.io/images/site_content/07.jpg" />
				<p>Lower Woodland’s athletic fields trace back to Guy C. Phinney’s late-1800s estate layout. After Seattle acquired the land in 1899, the Olmsted Brothers’ 1910 plan formalized the park’s expanded athletic use.</p>
				<p>Shoreline changes beginning in 1911 opened additional playable space, and by 1913 a third field was in place. Later additions—including grandstands (1915) and a shelter with dressing rooms (1929)—show how quickly the community embraced the grounds. Today’s baseball and softball diamonds rest on more than a century of neighborhood sport; you can explore the complex on <a class="ncll" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lower+Woodland+Park+Ballfields/@47.6690026,-122.3395151,15z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a>.</p>
