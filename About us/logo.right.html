    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <p>The North Central Little League (NCLL) logo redesign that produced the <strong>2025 Logo Refresh</strong> was a deliberate, collaborative effort. This page documents the milestones so families and volunteers can see how we arrived at the final badge.</p>

        <h2 class="left">⚾ 2025 Logo Redesign Process Timeline</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> Identified the need for a contemporary, inclusive mark that represents both softball and baseball.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Partnered with an NCLL parent designer while board members provided feedback along the way.</li>
            <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Ensured alignment with Little League requirements (no ball illustration, clarity at small sizes, cross-format flexibility).</li>
            <li><strong>Concept Presentation (Nov 19):</strong> Three directions were shown: “Field of Dreams,” “Sandlot,” and “League of Our Own.”</li>
            <li><strong>Direction Chosen:</strong> “Field of Dreams” advanced so the team could fine-tune color balance, gender representation, and scalability.</li>
            <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> Two review cycles produced clean geometry, simplified line weights, and a standard palette (core red, deep navy, white).</li>
            <li><strong>Final Approval (Dec 17):</strong> The Board confirmed the final badge along with its supporting lockups.</li>
        </ol>
