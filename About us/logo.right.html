        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><span>Initiation</span>: The need for a new logo was identified, with the aim of creating
                    a design that was more inclusive of both baseball and softball. Chris Cunningham took the lead on this
                    initiative.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Collaboration</span>: Chris Cunningham collaborated with another NCLL parent who has
                    graphic design skills to develop the new logo. Additionally, other board members including Nicole, Ryan,
                    Kirsten, and Cole were involved in the process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Design Constraints:</span> It was important to adhere to Little League
                    rules, which stipulate that the logo cannot include any balls.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Conceptualization and Presentation</span>: By the NCLL board meeting on
                    November 19th, three distinct logo concepts were presented to the board: "Field of Dreams," "Sandlot," and
                    "League of Our Own".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Selection of Initial Direction</span>: During the November 19th meeting, the
                    board selected the "Field of Dreams" concept to move forward with for further development. The board
                    also discussed elements such as accent colors and the neutrality of the logo.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Refinement and Review</span>: Following the initial selection, the board
                    underwent two rounds of visual design mockup reviews. This suggests an iterative process where the chosen
                    concept was refined based on feedback.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Final Approval</span>: The final version of the new NCLL logo was voted
                    on and approved by the board on December 17th. This decision came after the two rounds of design mockup
                    reviews.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The NCLL logo redesign was a collaborative and iterative process, beginning with the need for a more
