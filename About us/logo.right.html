    <section id="introduction">
        <h2 class="left">Overview</h2>
        <p>NCLL refreshed its visual identity for 2025 to create a unified mark that represents <strong>both softball and baseball</strong>, modernizes presentation, and remains compliant with Little League branding rules. Below is a concise record of how the final logo was developed and approved.</p>

    <!-- Timeline -->
    <section id="timeline">
        <h2 class="left">Timeline</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initiation</strong>: Need identified for an inclusive, contemporary mark; Chris Cunningham volunteered to coordinate.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Partnered with an NCLL parent designer; feedback gathered from board members (Nicole, Ryan, Kirsten, Cole, others).</li>
            <li><strong>Constraints</strong>: Aligned to Little League requirements (no depiction of a ball; clarity at small sizes; multi-format versatility).</li>
            <li><strong>Concept Presentation (Nov 19)</strong>: Three directions shared: “Field of Dreams,” “Sandlot,” “League of Our Own.”</li>
            <li><strong>Direction Chosen</strong>: “Field of Dreams” advanced; discussion covered accent color balance, neutral gender representation, and scalability.</li>
            <li><strong>Refinement</strong>: Two iterative review cycles produced cleaned geometry, simplified line weight, and standardized color palette (core red / deep navy / white).</li>
            <li><strong>Final Approval (Dec 17)</strong>: Board vote confirmed adoption of the final badge and supporting lockups.</li>
        </ol>
