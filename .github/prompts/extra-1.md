#### Coach Assignments  

Four head coaches assigned, each with their children on their teams. Assistant coaches distributed based on child placement. All parent-child relationships maintained.

#### Player Assignments  

45 players distributed across 3 teams (15 each). Strong teammate request groups kept together: Cameron Ginsburgh's group, Myles Clinch's group, Louis Wick's group, and St. Benedict group. Some players may need to be shifted to Triple-AAA based on age/skill.
