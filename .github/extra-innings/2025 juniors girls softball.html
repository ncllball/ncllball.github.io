            <p>Shoreline LL, North Central LL, and Queen Anne LL are 100% volunteer run non-profit organizations that rely on generous donations from the community to support budgets for travel to state, regional, and national tournament venues. Every donation, big or small, goes directly toward travel, lodging, and meal costs for our players and their families.</p>
