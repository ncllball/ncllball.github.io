# Team Naming Standard (Draft)

## Why this format
Sponsors arrive after teams need names. A two-phase format keeps a stable identifier early, then swaps in sponsors later without breaking internal tracking.

## Standard format
`[DivisionShort]-[Year]-[Team#]-[PrimaryName]`

- **DivisionShort**: short code for division
- **Year**: four-digit season year
- **Team#**: two-digit team number (01, 02, 03…)
- **PrimaryName**: Phase 1 = coach last name or internal nickname, Phase 2 = sponsor

## Phase 1 (pre-sponsor)
Use coach last name or an internal nickname:
- Example: `AA-2026-04-Smith`
- Example: `KCP-2026-02-Randall`

## Phase 2 (sponsors assigned)
Swap only the final segment to sponsor:
- Example: `AA-2026-04-KensMarket`
- Example: `KCP-2026-02-<Sponsor>`

## Rules to keep it consistent
1. **Team# stays the same** across phases.
2. **PrimaryName in Phase 1 is never a sponsor.**
3. Use the same **DivisionShort** list every season.

## DivisionShort list (current)
- `T` = Tee-ball
- `KCP` = Kindergarten Coach Pitch
- `A` = A Baseball
- `AA` = AA Baseball
- `AAA` = AAA Baseball
- `Maj` = Majors Baseball
- `Jr` = Juniors Baseball
- `Sr` = Seniors Baseball
- `Test` = internal/testing only

## Notes from current exports
- Current exports mix numbering + coach name + sponsor formats.
- The two-phase approach keeps early names usable and allows a clean sponsor swap later.
