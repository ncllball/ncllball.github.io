Here is the plan:

(It turns out my flight is actually around 330 so earlier than I thought.) I assume we are talking the saame lagnuage here and you should be able to tell everything I'm presenting. If not, then something isn't accounted by one of us for but I don't think that's the case.

1. You work on the things at the bottom of these two pages.
2. When I get on the plane and in the air around 430 or so, I'll check in and clean those up.
3. I will finalize the rosters and ping you so you can double check them.
4. I can trigger a 'bulk' transfer that transfers all the kids at once and silently (with no email).
5. You do one last double check after that and then I can post the rosters and that's it.
6. You may want to ready the coaches to have a quick intro email ready to go out at that time too.

Let me know any questions!
