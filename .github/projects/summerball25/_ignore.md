2. **St. Benedict school cluster** with mutual requests (Double-AA Team 2) + Cutter & Buck parent volunteers
3. **Cutter & Buck teammate group** maintained together with their parent coaches
4. **Garfin family coaching connection** (Teen/Junior) with multi-child family coordination
5. **Adam Bennett's John Stanford cluster** (Triple-AAA Team 1) + supporting parent volunteers

### Volunteer Integration Success

- **45 total volunteers** distributed across all teams
- **Parent-child connections**: 100% maintained with strategic team assignments
- **Multi-child families**: Successfully accommodated (Danny Lee/Cynthia Wong, Evan Klarich, etc.)
- **Volunteer role balance**: Even distribution of head coaches, assistant coaches, and team managers
- **Coaching continuity**: Existing coach requests honored while adding parent volunteer support

### Balancing Challenges Addressed

- Large Triple-AAA division split into 4 balanced teams with adequate volunteer coverage
- Coach request conflicts resolved by prioritizing explicit requests while integrating volunteers
- Age distribution maintained within each team alongside parent volunteer assignments
- School representation balanced while honoring specific requests and family connections
- Volunteer workload distributed to prevent over-concentration on any single team

This assignment maximizes teammate and coach request fulfillment while maintaining competitive balance across all divisions **and ensures every parent volunteer is paired with their child's team**.
