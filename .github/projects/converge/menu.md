## Strategy & Why (GPT‑5 summary)

Objectives

- Raise donations via Venmo and engage alumni as donors
- Keep Home and Team Central (Sports Connect requirements)
- Make the site more informative and actionable, especially on mobile

Approach

- Keep top nav lean and task‑oriented; use a hamburger for mobile
- Elevate fundraising with a dedicated Support tab positioned immediately after Register
- Group play options under Programs and audience tools under Resources
- Use Season as a current‑year hub and surface All‑Stars seasonally

Why this works

- Reduces clicks to Donate and Alumni, directly supporting fundraising KPIs
- Clear mental model: Programs (what to play), Season (when/what’s happening), Resources (how to do it), Get Involved (time/volunteer)
- Mirrors common Sports Connect patterns while reflecting NCLL priorities

## Recommended Top-Level Navigation (8 items)

Based on analysis of other Sports Connect leagues and your goals (donations, alumni engagement, better UX):

1. **Home** (required by Sports Connect)
2. **2026** (current year hub)
3. **Programs** (all divisions/activities)
4. **Register** (primary CTA button)
5. **Resources** (parent/coach tools)
6. **Get Involved** (volunteer recruitment)
7. **About** (org info)
8. **Support** (fundraising priority)

## Why This Structure Works

### Aligns with NCLL Goals

- **Support as #4** elevates fundraising (Venmo donations, alumni engagement)
- Clear volunteer path via "Get Involved"
- "Resources" consolidates help content for mobile UX
- Maintains Sports Connect requirements

### Matches Sports Connect League Patterns

After reviewing similar leagues:

- Registration always prominent
- Programs/Divisions grouped together
- Volunteer/Support separate from Resources
- About/Contact at end
