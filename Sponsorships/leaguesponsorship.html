    <h4 class="left">Introduction</h4>

    <p>Thank you for considering partnering with us as a 2025 NCLL sponsor. Without the generous contributions of
        volunteers, private individuals, and business sponsorships, our mission would not be possible. We are deeply
        grateful for our community, whose support has made NCLL such a first-rate experience for our players and their
        families for 60 years. NCLL is a 501(c)(3) organization.</p>
    <p>To be successful, NCLL depends on a tremendous amount of support from our local community. Your sponsorship helps
        us offset the costs of equipment, uniforms, field rentals, maintenance expenses, training materials, and all the
        associated costs of conducting our league. It also helps provide financial assistance to kids who would
        otherwise not be able to play. As a sponsor, you benefit too by being recognized as a supporter of the youth in
        our community!</p>
    <p>As we prepare for the beginning of another fun season, we hope you will join us as part of our sponsorship
        community. From our Board of Directors, our families and volunteers, and most especially from our young baseball
        and softball players who have an exceptional Little League experience with your support... thank you.</p>
