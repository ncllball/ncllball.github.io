Welcome to NCLL's 2024–25 Winter Training for AAA & Majors Baseball

Just so you know, while I clearly pushed to give  "Summerball26" to give the season a name that will stick, and leaned into it. For Winterball, it's more about just extending that organizational consistency, so I went with Winterball26 here.
