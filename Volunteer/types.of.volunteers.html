    <p><span class="emphasis">No experience is required</span> to become a volunteer. Most of the volunteer opportunities require little or no
        training. NCLL will provide you with any necessary training (as well as support and encouragement) to help you
        succeed. There are <span class="emphasis">four primary Volunteer Roles</span> at NCLL:</p>

    <h2 class="left">1 — Team-Level Volunteering</h2>

    <p><span class="emphasis">Head Coach:</span> Leads the team, makes key decisions, recruits staff, plans practices, assigns positions,
        enforces rules, and fosters a love of baseball. The NCLL Board and volunteers provide strong support.</p>
    <p><span class="emphasis">Assistant Coach:</span> The backbone of our league, assisting with younger players, running drills, and
        helping the Head Coach focus on individual instruction. If you can follow directions, you can assist!</p>
    <p id="team-manager"><span class="emphasis">Team Manager:</span> Often considered the "Team Mom" or "Team Dad," this role involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Helping with pitch count and/or scorekeeping</li>
        <li>Assisting in the dugout</li>
        <li>Distributing uniforms</li>
        <li>Collecting paperwork</li>
        <li>Coordinating the end-of-season party</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="left">2 — League-Level Volunteering</h2>

    <p><span class="emphasis">Board Members:</span> The NCLL Board oversees operations and votes on key positions annually. Many
        volunteers start by running a program or initiative before joining the Board.</p>
    <p><span class="emphasis">Key Volunteers:</span> These volunteers identify a need, passion, or problem and help the Board find
        solutions. Tasks range from organizing Photo Day to managing the website. Let us know how you'd like to help!
    </p>

    <h2 class="left">3 — Umpires</h2>

    <p>Often called <span class="emphasis">the "third team on the field"</span>, NCLL boasts one of the best umpire crews in the district. While many
        believe umpires are part of Little League, they actually operate independently and work <em>with</em> us, not
        <em>for</em> us. By joining the Umpire Registry, umpires gain access to a unique network dedicated to improving
        the game for players everywhere.</p>

    <p>
        Please see NCLL's 'Reach Out' page for umpires for more information on how to get involved with our umpire
        program.
    </p>

    <h2 class="left">4 — Ad-Hoc Volunteering</h2>
    <p>For those who can't commit to a season-long role, there are plenty of one-time or short-term opportunities to
        pitch in. From field maintenance to event support, every bit of help makes a difference!</p>
    <p><span class="emphasis">Join us in making a difference!</span> For more details on how you can volunteer, please visit our <a
