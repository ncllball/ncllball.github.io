<h2 id="background-check" class="left">Background Check</h2>
<p><span>Background checks are required for certain volunteer roles, especially those involving direct contact with
        players</span>. To complete the background check, volunteers in NCLL must fill out and
    submit a volunteer application online each calendar year. After registering as a volunteer, you'll receive an email
    with instructions for completing your background check. This email will include a link to the JDP platform, our
    secure background check service. The link in the email is valid for 14 days, so it's important to complete the
    questionnaire and submit it promptly. Background checks must be completed annually before engaging with players.
    <span>Before engaging with players, all volunteers are required by Law to complete a background check</span>. Little
    League may deny individuals the privilege of volunteering if their background check reveals information that may be
    detrimental to the positive development of young people, other volunteers, and/or Little League International. In
    some leagues, a government ID may be needed to complete the background check.</p>
