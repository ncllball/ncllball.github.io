        alt="">Featured Volunteer Opportunity: Schedule Coordinator
</h2>
<p>Do you just want to hit that <span>PLAY</span> button?</p>

<p>North Central Little League is looking for a volunteer to schedule fields for practices and games for the regular
    season. Are you organized? Can you meet deadlines and pay attention to details? Do you love Tetris and solving
    puzzles, getting all the pieces just so? Are you looking for a way to give back to the NCLL community? This is for
    you.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2116213" class="ncll">Schedule Coordinator</a> is primarily
    responsible for
    scheduling fields for practices and games for the regular
    season. It is a critical and time-sensitive function ensuring all teams have field space to practice and play. Being
    comfortable with software or programs for processing data is a helpful skill, and if you are knowledgable about
    other tech solutions for process improvement, there is opportunity to apply that knowledge here!</p>
