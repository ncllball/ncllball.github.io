    <p>Did you know that many companies match their employees' volunteer hours with cash grants to the nonprofits they volunteer with? These corporate philanthropy programs—often called Volunteer Match or Time Matching—can significantly benefit our league. Historically, companies like Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks and more have well-thought-out programs to support their employees giving back to their communities. It’s not just Fortune 500 companies, though, that support their employees’ communities, smaller companies have programs as well.</p><p><a class="ncll" href="https://www.uwkc.org/donate/matching-gifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See if your company offers this kind of program</a>.</p>
    

    
    <p><strong>Action item for volunteers:</strong> Ask your HR department if your company has a program to donate dollars for your volunteer time. Each company has its own process.</p>

    <p>Volunteer time already means the world to NCLL — we literally could not operate without volunteers. With these company-giving programs, volunteers can easily support what they care about even more. Time literally is money. Funds from volunteer giving programs help pay for uniforms, player development, equipment and more.</p>
