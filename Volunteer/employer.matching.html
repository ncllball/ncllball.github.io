    <h2 id="employer-matching-gifts" class="left">Employer Matching Gifts</h2>
    <p>Did you know that many companies match not only their employees' monetary donations to nonprofits but also their
        volunteer hours with cash grants? These corporate philanthropy programs—often called Volunteer Match or Time
        Matching—can significantly benefit our league.</p>
    <p>In Washington, a volunteer hour is valued at $27.54 (per Independent Sector). If a coach or team parent
        volunteers an average of 10 hours per week, that’s over $275 per week. Over a four-month season, that adds up to
        $4,400—funds your employer could be donating to North Central Little League (NCLL) just for the time you’re
        already giving!</p>
    <h4 id="does-your-employer-offer-volunteer-matching" class="left">Does Your Employer Offer Volunteer Matching?</h4>
    <p>Many local employers have programs to match volunteer hours with financial contributions. Below is a list of
        companies known to offer such benefits. However, every company has different processes for signing up or
        reporting hours. Even if your employer isn’t listed, check with your Human Resources department to see if they
        participate!</p>
