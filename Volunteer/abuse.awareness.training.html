        <p>
            <span>Abuse awareness training is a mandatory course</span> for all Little League volunteers, essential for
            ensuring
            the safety and well-being of all participants. This annual training equips volunteers with the knowledge to
            <span>recognize and prevent abuse, create a safe environment, and understand their responsibilities</span>.
            To
            complete the training, volunteers must access the training platform, create an account or log in, enroll in
            the
            course, complete all modules, pass a final assessment, and obtain a certificate of completion.
            <span>Completion of
                abuse awareness training is a prerequisite for volunteering</span>.
