            <p><strong>Welcome to the new Volunteer Hub.</strong> This is the one place to raise your hand for the roles and quick-call crews that keep NCLL running.</p>
            <p><strong>Start with core needs:</strong> <span class="ncll">coach</span>, <span class="ncll">assistant coach</span>, and <span class="ncll">team manager</span>. If you have more to give-or just an extra hour here and there-join our opt-in lists for fast callouts by email or text.</p>
            <p><strong>No Experience? No Problem!</strong> No experience is required to become a volunteer. Most of the volunteer opportunities require little or no training. NCLL will provide you with any necessary training (as well as support and encouragement) to help you succeed. There are four primary Volunteer Roles at NCLL:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Game-day and event helpers (photo day, HR Derby, meetings)</li>
                <li>Field crew on wet or windy days</li>
                <li>On-call umpires and scorekeeping support</li>
                <li>Gear moves, setup/teardown, and odd jobs</li>
                <li>Special skills (photography, graphics, carpentry, tech)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Anyone can help-parents, grandparents, siblings, neighbors, alumni, and community partners. Pick what fits your time; if a callout does not work, no worries, maybe next time.</p>

                        <p>Often called the "third team on the field", NCLL boasts one of the best umpire crews in the district. While many believe umpires are part of Little League, they actually operate independently and work with us, not for us. By joining the Umpire Registry, umpires gain access to a unique network dedicated to improving the game for players everywhere.</p>
                        <p>Please see NCLL's 'Reach Out' page for umpires for more information on how to get involved with our umpire program.</p>

                        <p class="ncll-card__blurb"><strong>Employer Matching Gifts.</strong> Did you know that many companies match their employees' volunteer hours with cash grants to the nonprofits they volunteer with? These corporate philanthropy programs--often called Volunteer Match or Time Matching--can significantly benefit our league. Historically, companies like Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks and more have well-thought-out programs to support their employees giving back to their communities. It's not just Fortune 500 companies, though, that support their employees' communities; smaller companies have programs as well. See if your company offers this kind of program.</p>

With these company-giving programs, volunteers can easily support what they care about even more. Time literally is money.
