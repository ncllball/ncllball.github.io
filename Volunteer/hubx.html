            <p><strong>Welcome to the new Volunteer Hub.</strong> This is the one place to raise your hand for the roles and quick-call crews that keep NCLL running.</p>
            <p><strong>No Experience? No Problem!</strong> No experience is required to become a volunteer. Most of the volunteer opportunities require little or no training. NCLL will provide you with any necessary training (as well as support and encouragement) to help you succeed. There are four primary Volunteer Roles at NCLL you can read about below: team level, league level, umpiring, and "pop-up" support.</p>
            <p>We've all got our place, come and find yours!</p>

Pop-Up Support volunteers are the flexible heroes who jump in for single-shift, ad hoc needs. Can't commit to a season-long role? No problem. From field maintenance to event support, every one-off helps, and it's commitment-free when you join our volunteer lists page.</p>

                        <p class="ncll-card__blurb"><strong>Employer Matching Gifts.</strong> Did you know that many companies match their employees' volunteer hours with cash grants to the nonprofits they volunteer with? These corporate philanthropy programs--often called Volunteer Match or Time Matching--can significantly benefit our league. Historically, companies like Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks and more have well-thought-out programs to support their employees giving back to their communities. It's not just Fortune 500 companies, though, that support their employees' communities; smaller companies have programs as well. See if your company offers this kind of program.</p>

                        <p>Volunteer time already means the world to NCLL--we literally could not operate without volunteers. With these company-giving programs, volunteers can easily support what they care about even more. Time literally is money. Funds from volunteer giving programs help pay for uniforms, player development, equipment and more.</p>
