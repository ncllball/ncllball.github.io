            <p><strong>Welcome to the new Volunteer Hub.</strong> This is the one place to raise your hand for the roles and quick-call crews that keep NCLL running.</p>
            <p><strong>No Experience? No Problem!</strong> No experience is required to become a volunteer. Most of the volunteer opportunities require little or no training. NCLL will provide you with any necessary training (as well as support and encouragement) to help you succeed. There are four primary Volunteer Roles at NCLL you can read about below: team level, league level, umpiring, and "pop-up" support.</p>
            <p>We've all got our place, come and find yours!</p>
