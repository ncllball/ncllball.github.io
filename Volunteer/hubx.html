                <strong>Our core volunteer needs remain — </strong><span
                    class="ncll">coach</span>, <span class="ncll">assistant coach</span>, and <span class="ncll">team
                    manager
                </span>
                <strong> — these are additional volunteer opportunities</strong>.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Volunteer Lite</strong> is a new way to help out  — <em>in addition to</em> our regular roles.
                These lists are for folks who want to pitch in for specific events, with no long-term commitment or
                baseball experience required. We’ll reach out by email or text when help is needed—if you’re available,
                great! If not, maybe next time.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Anyone can volunteer—parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, retirees, community leaders, former
                ball players, friends, neighbors, and more. All parents of NCLL players are strongly encouraged to
                volunteer. It’s a great way to spend quality time with your child and support our community.

                    Baseball works best when we have plenty of people ready to help — parents, family, and community
                    members. Even occasional help keeps our fields and events running smoothly. If you can chip in,
