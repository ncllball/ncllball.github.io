        <p>For Little League All-Star teams, "co-leaguing" (sometimes called "co-teaming" or "tournament combination") allows <span>2-3 leagues to combine their eligible players to form a single All-Star team for tournament play.</span></p>
        
        <p>This is only approved by Little League International when individual leagues <span>do not have enough eligible players</span> to field a full All-Star team on their own, especially in divisions like Softball or the older Teenage Divisions. It requires a specific <span>Tournament Combination Request Form</span> and strict approval from District, Regional, and International Little League committees.</p>
