  <p>
    It's right there in our logo! Our home field is the Cloverleaf at Lower Woodland, featuring four 60-foot softball/baseball diamonds and one 90-foot turfed field. While most of our games happen at home, we also play at various area fields throughout the season. This guide covers all the locations where you'll find NCLL in action.</p>

    <p>Most games are played at Lower Woodland, but we sometimes use other fields. The image below illustrates Lower Woodland's counter-clockwise, cloverleaf numbering system and below that, a list of addresses for those likely alternative fields.</p>




<p>The numbering system may seem random at Lower Woodland until you realize the field numbering system follows a counterclockwise cloverleaf pattern.</p>
