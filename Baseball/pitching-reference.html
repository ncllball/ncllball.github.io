        <p>This page consolidates key pitching governance details used across North Central Little League (NCLL) Baseball divisions: maximum daily pitch counts, mandatory rest thresholds, and typical league age ranges per division. Always defer to the current season's <em>Official Little League Baseball Regulations</em> ("Green Book"). When discrepancies occur, Green Book rules and District guidance prevail.</p>

        <p>These are the standard Little League Baseball maximum pitch counts per pitcher in a calendar day (Regulation VI). NCLL follows these limits without local reduction. Managers should plan usage backwards from rest and availability needs (tournament, tight schedule weeks, make‑ups).</p>

        <p>Rest is determined by <em>pitches thrown in a day</em>. Crossing a threshold increases required calendar rest days before the pitcher may pitch again. A pitcher removed before reaching the next threshold keeps the lower rest requirement. If a pitcher reaches 20 pitches during an at‑bat and is removed before the batter completes the at‑bat, the threshold used is based on the final count at batter completion.</p>
