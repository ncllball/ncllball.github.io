            <h2 class="left">Find the right division for your player</h2>
            <p>North Central Little League offers baseball divisions for players ages 5-16, from first-time players
                learning the basics to competitive teams preparing for high school ball. Each division is designed to
                match players' developmental stages with appropriate skill challenges and game formats.</p>

            <p><strong>How to choose:</strong> Divisions are primarily based on your child's league age (their age on
                August 31<sup>st</sup>). Hover over any division card below to see full details about practice
                schedules, field locations, and what makes each division unique. If you're unsure which division is
                right, contact our registrar for guidance.</p>

            <p>Registration for all divisions opens in early January. Assessments for AAA and Majors divisions typically
                occur in late February.</p>

            <p><strong>Note for coaches:</strong> If you need more detailed information than what's provided here - such

                                                    years. This division allows league age 6 kids an opportunity to play a slightly more

                                                    Parents considering signing up their player for this division should consider whether the
