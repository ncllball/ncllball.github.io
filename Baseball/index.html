    <section id="introduction">
        <p>Here you'll find a brief explanation of the appropriate ages for each division and a bit about the way they play.
            Baseball is open to all genders. If you believe your player can compete at a level higher than he or she has
            been offered, please indicate so in the registration process in the space provided. Assessments will be held in
            late January/early February to determine placement. Our primary concern is whether the player can compete safely
            in the higher division.</p>
        <p>See <a href="https://ncllball.sportngin.com/registration-league-age-division-chart" class="ncll">League Age/Divisions</a> for

                division allows league age 6 kids an opportunity to play a slightly more challenging game with a moving ball and
                actual outs, but is also adaptive for kids at varying skill levels. Parents considering signing up their player
                for this division should consider whether the kid has the coordination, attention span for hit balls, and
                emotional maturity to handle outs.</p>
