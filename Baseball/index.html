            <h2 class="left">Find the right division for your player</h2>
            <p>North Central Little League offers baseball divisions for players ages 5-16, from first-time players learning the basics to competitive teams preparing for high school ball. Each division is designed to match players' developmental stages with appropriate skill challenges and game formats.</p>

            <p><strong>How to choose:</strong> Divisions are primarily based on your child's league age (their age on August 31<sup>st</sup>). Hover over any division card below to see full details about practice schedules, field locations, and what makes each division unique. If you're unsure which division is right, contact our registrar for guidance.</p>

            <p>Registration for all divisions opens in early January. Assessments for AAA and Majors divisions typically occur in late February.</p>

            <p><strong>Note for coaches:</strong> If you need more detailed information than what's provided here — such as specific rules, draft procedures, or coaching resources — you're probably a coach! Head over to our <a href="../Coaching/index.html" class="ncll">Coaching section</a> for comprehensive guides, training materials, and division-specific coaching information.</p>

                        <p>Kindergarten Coach Pitch, or "Kindy Coach Pitch", is a new division that we have piloted for two years. This division allows league age 6 kids an opportunity to play a slightly more challenging game with a moving ball and actual outs, but is also adaptive for kids at varying skill levels. Parents considering signing up their player for this division should consider whether the kid has the coordination, attention span for hit balls, and emotional maturity to handle outs.</p>
