## Board update — registration prep

Hey board, quick download before we open registration. Keeping it casual so you have the talking points handy.

- **Testing reality:** Sports Connect only lets us fully test when a program is “live,” even if the link isn’t posted. If you want to walk through it with your own player, ping me and I’ll drop the closed program in your cart so nothing leaks before being ready.
- **Build cadence:** I stand up the baseball flow first ([Baseball divisions overview](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2111979)), then port the same pattern over to softball ([Softball divisions overview](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2111980)) so the language and cards stay synced. So Softball will be completed shortly after Baseball.
- **Medical release trim:** The refreshed [registration instructions](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2244720) point families at the slimmer copy, but they still need the [Little League medical release form](https://www.littleleague.org/downloads/medical-release-form/). Hoping for true in-line e-sign next season.
- **Mobile-first cards:** All our new tiles live across the hub pages (example: [uniform sizing](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2113971)), which keeps the layout reusable and phone-friendly for both families and helpers.
- **Uniform push:** Registration now links straight back to the [uniform sizing](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2113971) so we cut down on wrong jersey/hat picks in March.
- **Volunteer nudge:** The new [volunteer lists page](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2121042) is looking for final edits—the top two lists are solid, the rest are drafts, so send ideas.
- **Season timeline:** Give [the 2026 season timeline](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2244689) a once-over.
- **UPDATED Pages we’ll see most of during registration:** [Player Development programs](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2111984), [uniform sizing](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2113971), [baseball landing](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2111979), [softball landing](https://www.ncllball.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2111980).


While everyone checks it out, Let me know nay other questions. Ill be working on porting the volunteer and umpire information and links over.
