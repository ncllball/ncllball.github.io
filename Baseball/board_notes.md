# 1 going well here are some notes

- the whole theme is to share as much information as possible but in a really digestible way
- mobile was even more important
- settled on these tiles
- the main places youll see them are:


Player Development Programs
uniform sizing charts
baseball information
softball information

- reusable, the ai only has to know one things and it will know it really well

i do baseball first and then adapt that to softball
i pruned a bunch for a few reasons:
	i wasnt comfortable with how it went
	that stuff was really valuable when we wrote it out of covid



## player development


easier and faster this year
