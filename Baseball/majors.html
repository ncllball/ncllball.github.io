    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <p>Welcome to the Majors Division of our little league baseball program! As a Double Goal League, we have two
            primary objectives: <em>player development</em> and <em>competitive success</em>. These guidelines aim to strike
            a balance between these goals, ensuring that our players grow both on and off the field. Our guidelines are
            intended to help Managers navigate these two important goals.</p>
        <p>Majors will follow the green book rules set forth by Little League International. The following is provided as
            clarification or exceptions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>All pitch count and catcher eligibility rules are defined by Little League and can be found in the Official
                    Regulations and Playing Rules book provided to every manager</li>
                <li>It’s essential for all managers to be aware of these rules and consider the league age of their pitchers</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="pitch-counts-and-rest-days" class="left">Pitch Counts and Rest Days</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Refer to the official Baseball Pitch Count by League Age guidelines for specific pitch count limits based on
                    player age</li>

            <h4 id="scorekeeping-responsibility" class="left">Scorekeeping Responsibility</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The home team serves as the official scorekeeper and maintains the pitch count record for both teams</li>
                <li>As a best practice, scorekeepers and pitch counters from both teams should compare information at the end of
                    each inning</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="pre-game-meeting" class="left">Pre-Game Meeting</h4>

            </ul>
            <h4 id="violations-and-penalties" class="left">Violations and Penalties</h4>
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Managers should consider not only pitches per game but also innings pitched per season for player safety</li>

                    for making informed decisions about pitching availability</li>
