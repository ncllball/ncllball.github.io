        <p>This document provides guidelines for conducting games at the AA Division level of play for the 2024 season. As a
            developmental league, our primary goal is to prepare players to move up the Little League ladder and eventually
            play in the  Majors.</p>
        <p><span><em>Rules</em></span> are non-negotiable and must be adhered to and come from either the official
            Little League Rule Book (a.k.a "The Green Book") or by NCLL board-approved policy.</p>
        <p><span><em>Guidelines</em></span> are nuances within the game agreed to by the Managers and League.</p>

            <p>Your catchers may not have the ability to throw out base runners, and that’s perfectly fine. Here are some
                essential points to emphasize:</p>
            <h4 id="keep-the-ball-in-front" class="left">Keep the Ball in Front**:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The primary goal for catchers is to keep the ball in front of them</li>
                <li>Encourage them to block any balls in the dirt or those that bounce unpredictably</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="quick-reaction-to-balls-in-the-dirt" class="left">Quick Reaction to Balls in the Dirt**:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Catchers should demonstrate quick reflexes when locating balls in the dirt</li>
                <li>React promptly to prevent wild pitches or passed balls</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="understanding-the-game-situation" class="left">Understanding the Game Situation**:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Help catchers understand the game context</li>
                <li>Where are the outs? What’s the score? What inning is it?</li>
                <li>This awareness contributes to better decision-making</li>

        <h4 id="foul-tips" class="left">Foul Tips</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>In the 8/9ers division, we need to teach base running skills beyond the basics seen in younger leagues</li>
                <li>Not every hit is a single; players who hit legitimate doubles should take two bases, and three on a triple</li>
                <li>The main point to teach is to get out of the batter’s box quickly and look to your base coach for
                    instructions</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Always have a 1st and 3rd base coach for player development</li>
                <li>Parents in the stands can fill this role</li>

            <ul>
                <li>For the first half of the season, players will NOT steal bases</li>
                <li>This allows catchers and pitchers to develop skills without worrying about base runners</li>
                <li>In the second half of the season, players can steal bases in specific situations:</li>
                <li>Passed balls or wild pitches that get by the catcher</li>
                <li>Dropped balls on the return to the pitcher (1B to 2B and 2B to 3B)</li>

                represents their own team)</li>
            <li>If managers agree, a 10th player can play a 4th outfield position</li>
            <li>This flexibility helps ensure that everyone gets even playing time, especially on larger teams</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The AA Division provides our own Umpires</li>
            <li>The home team will provide the Chief Umpire and will be behind home plate</li>
            <li>The visiting team will provide the Field Umpire</li>
            <li>If an umpire is not available at game time, the home team will provide an umpire. If this guest umpire does
                not have protective gear, they will call the game from behind the pitching rubber. </li>
            <li>The Chief Umpire has final say on ALL calls</li>

        <ul>
            <li>We play with a 5-run rule per inning</li>
            <li>Once five runs are scored, the inning is over, and the batting team returns to the field</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="time-limit--inning-limit" class="left">Time Limit / Inning Limit</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Our games have a time limit of 90 minutes or 6 innings, whichever comes first</li>
            <li>You will have 30 minutes of field time to share between teams before your game begins for warm-ups</li>
            <li>For eager team members, encourage them to warm up in the deep outfield before your field becomes available</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="dugout-assignment" class="left">Dugout Assignment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For all games in NCLL, the home team takes the 3rd base dugout, and the visiting team takes the 1st base
                dugout</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="mercy-rule" class="left">Mercy Rule</h4>

        </ul>
        <h4 id="pre-game-warm-ups" class="left">Pre-Game Warm-Ups</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pending field availability, each team receives 15 minutes to warm up before the 1st pitch</li>
            <li>The visiting team warms up first, and the home team warms up second, staying on the field to begin the game</li>
            <li>If 30 minutes is not available before the scheduled start time, teams will agree on a mutual number of
                minutes for warm-ups</li>
            <li>The field is under the control of the umpire at the scheduled start time. If managers want to warm up after
                the scheduled start time, they should request permission from the umpire, who will have the final decision.
            </li>
            <li>A team that is not ready to warm up at their scheduled time will forfeit their warm-up</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Gloves for this level of player should be between 9-11 inches</li>
                <li>Check your players’ gloves and ensure their names and phone numbers are on them</li>
                <li>Advise the player’s parent if they are using equipment that is not appropriate</li>
                <li>While specialty gloves (such as 1st base or catcher gloves) can be used at this level, try to discourage
                    their use. Most of these gloves are too large for players in the 9ers division.</li>

            <h4 id="bats-1" class="left">Bats</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bats should be between 26-30 inches in length and weigh between 15-20 oz (this is just a rule of thumb)</li>
                <li>A batter should be able to hold the bat with only their left hand (if they are a right-handed batter) and
                    move it slowly across their body on a level plane without dipping</li>
                <li>Be on the lookout for bats that players picked because they look cool or the red one, but are completely too
                    big for them. Limit the use of oversized bats to just the owner.</li>

                <li>In the past, there have been concerns regarding lice</li>
                <li>If a player has those concerns, they can purchase their own helmet</li>
                <li>Remember, as the manager or coach, you have the final authority on anything safety-related, so any
                    “player-owned” equipment must meet your satisfaction</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Your equipment bags will have a complete set of catchers gear, including a glove</li>
                <li>Some players will love to catch, while others may want to avoid it. Try not to assign catching duties to a
                    player who wants nothing to do with it during the first game.</li>
                <li>Encourage Mom or Dad to help their player get ready to catch while your team is up to bat</li>
                <li>For safety, all catchers’ masks must have a “dangler” attached to be used in a Little League game. If you’re
                    missing one, ask for a replacement or share the helmet with the dangler between teams until yours can be
                    fixed.</li>
                <li>A hard cup is part of the catcher’s uniform</li>

        <p>While the AA Division is non-competitive, game scores are kept, but there are no playoffs or standings. As with
            any sport, there will be individual and team successes and failures. Here are some key points to remember:</p>
        <h4 id="positive-perspective" class="left">Positive Perspective</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>At all times during the game, find the good in each play</li>
            <li>Even if the ball sails over the first baseman’s head, acknowledge the effort—it’s still a “strong throw”
                from the player</li>
            <li>Every strikeout has at least some number of “good cuts” in it</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="be-an-advocate-and-cheerleader" class="left">Be an Advocate and Cheerleader</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Be your team’s advocate and head cheerleader</li>
            <li>Encourage players, celebrate their efforts, and create a positive atmosphere</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="parent-participation" class="left">Parent Participation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Parents are welcome to participate in practices and game days at the AA level</li>
            <li>However, anyone participating with the players on a regular basis must complete a background check and be
                cleared by NCLL to participate</li>
            <li>Encourage willing parents to get involved; they are our future coaches</li>
