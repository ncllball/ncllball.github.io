        <h2 id="pitching--catching" class="left">Pitching &amp; Catching</h2>
        <p>In North Central Little League's A Division, pitching is facilitated using spring-arm mechanical pitching machines
            (PMs). Here are the key details:</p>

        <section id="pitching-machine">
            <h4 id="pitching-machine-operation" class="left">Pitching Machine Operation:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>During gameplay and practices, a coach or parent from the team at bat operates the PM</li>
                <li>The PM uses a foot pedal to release a spring-loaded arm, propelling the ball toward home plate</li>
                <li>Coaches adjust (only coaches or parents should be operating the pitching machines!) the controls (velocity and
                    trajectory) based on player skill levels.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="placement-of-the-pitching-machine" class="left">Placement of the Pitching Machine</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The PM is set up just in front of the closest pitching rubber to home plate</li>
                <li>Adjustments may be needed depending on the specific machine’s functionality</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="pitching-machine-setup" class="left">Pitching Machine Setup</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before a game, the home-team manager configures the PM</li>
                <li>Typically, the PM is set to slower pitching speeds with a moderate trajectory</li>
                <li>The goal is to achieve a slight arc, landing just behind home plate</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="batted-ball-off-the-pitching-machine" class="left">Batted Ball Off the Pitching Machine</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If a batted ball strikes the PM during a game, the ball remains in play</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="extended-rules-for-pm-issues" class="left">Extended Rules for PM Issues</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If the PM is broken or unavailable, coaches or parents pitch to their own team</li>
                <li>The substitute pitcher stands in front of the closest pitching rubber and throws at an appropriate speed</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="catching-rules">
            <h4 id="catching" class="left">Catching</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The defensive team provides a catcher</li>
                <li>Catchers wear protective gear (helmet with neck guard, chest protector, shin guards, and a protective cup)</li>
                <li>Blocking skills are developed through practice</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="catcher-position" class="left">Catcher Position</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Coaches ensure the catcher is in a squatting position, facing the PM before each pitch</li>
            </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>We play with a modified count</li>
            <li>The specific count may vary based on league rules</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="walks" class="left">Walks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There are no walks in the A Division</li>
            <li>Batters do not automatically advance to first base due to ball count</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="strikeouts" class="left">Strikeouts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Three strikes (swinging) result in an out</li>
            <li>Batters must swing at the third strike</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="courtesy-strike" class="left">Courtesy Strike</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The courtesy strike is used for players who need more time to develop their offensive skills</li>
            <li>Initially, consider playing with a 4-strike count for the whole team</li>
            <li>As the season progresses, transition to a 3-strike count</li>
            <li>Discuss strike calls with the opposing manager before each game</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="discontinuing-courtesy-strikes" class="left">Discontinuing Courtesy Strikes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop using courtesy strikes under the following conditions:</li>
            <li>Your team significantly outperforms the opponent offensively or defensively</li>
            <li>Your team builds a lead of 6 runs or more</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="outs" class="left">Outs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Three outs (either through fielding or strikeouts) switch sides</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="foul-tips" class="left">Foul Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Foul tips do not count as a third strike</li>
            <li>The batter remains at bat after a foul tip</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="bat-throwing" class="left">Bat Throwing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If a player throws the bat after an at-bat</li>
            <li>The player receives one warning</li>
            <li>If the behavior continues, the player is removed from the game for safety reasons</li>
            <li>Umpires and managers use discretion in enforcing this rule</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Base Running Section -->
    <section id="base-running">
        <h2 id="base-running" class="left">Base Running</h2>
        <h4 id="single-or-more" class="left">Single or More</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In the A Division, we focus on teaching base running skills</li>
            <li>Not every hit is a single, as it was in Tee Ball</li>
            <li>Players who hit a legitimate double should take two bases, and three on a triple</li>
            <li>The main point is to emphasize getting out of the batter’s box quickly and looking to the base coach for
                instructions</li>
            <li>Encourage players to break the habit of watching the ball roll and instead focus on their base coach</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="advancing-on-an-error" class="left">Advancing on an Error</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Errors are common in the A Division</li>
            <li>Help your opposing manager by taking just one base on an error</li>
            <li>Although a player may be able to advance further, limit this type of play to maintain fairness</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="base-coaches" class="left">Base Coaches</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For player development, always have a 1st and 3rd base coach</li>
            <li>Parents in the stands can take on this role</li>
            <li>Teach base coaches hand signals and how to guide players effectively</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="stealing-and-leading-off" class="left">Stealing and Leading Off</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no stealing or leading off at the A level</li>
            <li>Focus on fundamental base running skills without these advanced tactics</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="fielding">
        <h2 id="fielding" class="left">Fielding</h2>
        <h4 id="number-of-players-in-the-field" class="left">Number of Players in the Field</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To maximize playing time, you can have 10 fielders</li>
            <li>The extra player should play only in the outfield (left, left-center, right, and right-center)</li>
            <li>It’s acceptable to play with 10 defensive players even if your opponent has only 9; this ensures more playing
                time without significantly affecting competitiveness</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="infield-positions" class="left">Infield Positions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stick to the standard baseball lineup with 6 players in the infield</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="outfield-positions" class="left">Outfield Positions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Assign 3 or 4 players to the outfield</li>
            <li>Remind outfielders to keep their feet on the grass</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="encroachment" class="left">Encroachment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>While there’s no specific rule about encroachment, it’s best to avoid it</li>
            <li>Even players who need more development deserve opportunities to make plays</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="player-rotations" class="left">Player Rotations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Aim for equal innings in both the outfield and infield for all team members</li>
            <li>At the A Division level, there’s no need for position specialization</li>

            <li>The field umpire positions themselves around 2nd base</li>
            <li>They have the final say on any calls made in the field</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="coachpitcher’s-role" class="left">Coach/Pitcher’s Role</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>During a game, keep bats under your control</li>
            <li>Since there’s no warm-up circle in Little League, the on-deck batter should be in the dugout</li>
            <li>Place the bats on the fence OUTSIDE the dugout</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="bench-players" class="left">Bench Players</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bench players can:</li>

            <li>Serve as enthusiastic cheerleaders for their teammates</li>
            <li>Learn and teach baseball chants to create team spirit</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="inning-run-rule" class="left">Inning Run Rule</h4>

            <li>Gloves for this level of player should be between 9-11 inches</li>
            <li>Ensure that players’ names and phone numbers are on their gloves</li>
            <li>Advise parents if their child is using inappropriate equipment</li>
            <li>While specialty gloves (e.g., 1st base, catcher) can be used, discourage their use as they are often too large
                for A level players.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Check helmets for cracks or missing pads</li>
            <li>Some players may have concerns about lice; they can purchase their own helmet</li>
