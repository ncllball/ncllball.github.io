            <ul>
                <li>Gloves for this level of player will be between 9-11 inches</li>
                <li>Check your players’ gloves and ensure their names and phone numbers are on them</li>
                <li>Advise the player’s parent if they are using inappropriate equipment</li>
                <li>While specialty gloves (such as 1st base or catcher gloves) can be used, discourage their use at this level,
                    as most are too large for Tee-ball players</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="bats-1" class="left">Bats</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bats should be approximately 24-25 inches long and weigh around 11-16 oz</li>
                <li>A batter should be able to hold the bat with only their left hand (if they are a right-handed batter) and
                    move it slowly across their body on a level plane without dipping</li>
                <li>Be on the lookout for bats that players picked because they look cool but are too big for them. Limit the
                    use of oversized bats to their owners.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="helmets" class="left">Helmets</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Check helmets for cracks or missing pads</li>
                <li>Some players may have concerns about lice. If so, they can purchase their own helmet.</li>
                <li>Remember, as the manager, you have the final authority on safety-related matters. Any player-owned equipment
                    must meet your satisfaction.</li>

            <ul>

                <li>Some players will love to catch, while others may want to avoid it. Try not to assign catching duties to a
                    player who wants nothing to do with it during the first game.</li>
                <li>Encourage Mom or Dad to help their player get ready to catch while your team is up to bat</li>
                <li>For safety, all catchers’ masks must have a dangler attached to be used in a Little League game. If you’re
                    missing one, ask for a replacement or share a helmet with a dangler between teams until yours can be fixed.

    <!-- Concluding Section -->
    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2 id="final-thoughts" class="left">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>While Tee Ball is a non-competitive division in Little League with no official scorekeeping, it’s important to
            recognize that individual and team successes and failures are inherent to sports. Here are some key points to
            keep in mind:</p>
        <h4 id="positive-perspective" class="left">Positive Perspective</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>At all times during the game, find the positive aspects of each play</li>
            <li>Even if the ball sails over the first baseman’s head, acknowledge the effort and consider it a “strong
                throw” from the player</li>
            <li>Remember that every strikeout involves at least some good swings or attempts</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="be-an-advocate-and-cheerleader" class="left">Be an Advocate and Cheerleader</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>As the manager, be your team’s advocate and head cheerleader</li>
            <li>Encourage players, celebrate their efforts, and create a positive atmosphere</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="parent-participation" class="left">Parent Participation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Parents are welcome to participate in practices and game days at the Tee Ball level</li>
            <li>However, anyone participating with the players on a regular basis must complete a background check and be
                cleared by NCLL to participate</li>
            <li>Encourage willing parents to get involved; they are our future managers and coaches</li>
        </ul>
