        <h2 class="left">Kindergarten Coach Pitch Overview</h2>
        <p>Kindergarten Coach Pitch, or "Kindy Coach Pitch", is a new division that we have piloted for 2 years.&nbsp; This
            division allows league age 6 kids an opportunity to play a slightly more challenging game with a moving ball and
            actual outs, but is also adaptive for kids at varying skill levels. Parents considering signing up their player
            for this division should consider whether the kid has the coordination, attention span for hit balls, and
            emotional maturity to handle outs.</p>
