    <section id="introduction">
        <p>Welcome to the AAA Division of our little league baseball program! As a Double Goal League, we have two primary objectives: <em>player development</em> and <em>competitive success</em>. These guidelines aim to strike a balance between these goals, ensuring that our players grow both on and off the field. Our guidelines are intended to help Managers navigate these two important goals.</p>
        <p>AAA will follow the green book Little League International Rules; the following is provided as clarification or exception.</p>

    <section id="pitching">
        <h2 id="pitching" class="left">Pitching</h2>
        <h4 id="who-pitches" class="left">Who Pitches</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Any player on the roster can pitch, but each player has a maximum pitch count based on their age</li>
            <li>At the AAA division level, every player who desires to pitch should be given the opportunity to learn and develop this skill. Encouraging young pitchers helps them grow and contribute to the team.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="pitch-counts" class="left">Pitch Counts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pitch counts are crucial for player safety. The Baseball Pitch Count by League Age provides guidelines on how many pitches a player can throw based on their age.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the Baseball Rest Day Thresholds specify mandatory rest periods based on pitch count. Following these rules helps prevent overuse injuries.</li>
            <li>Early April / May outings should follow the <a class="ncll" href="/Baseball/pitching-reference.html#early-season">Early Season Ramp</a> targets before full max caps in June</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="pitching-position" class="left">Pitching Position</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The pitcher stands at the rubber, which is 46 feet away from home plate. This consistent distance ensures fair play and accurate pitching.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="resting-pitchers" class="left">Resting Pitchers</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The AAA Division follows Official Little League Rules regarding mandatory pitcher rest</li>
            <li>After pitching, players need rest to recover. Coaches should adhere to these guidelines to maintain player health.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="intentional-walks" class="left">Intentional Walks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Intentional walks must be completed with thrown pitches, and all pitches count toward the pitcher’s pitch count</li>
            <li>This rule ensures that intentional walks do not bypass pitch count restrictions</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="catching" class="left">Catching:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Catching is provided by players from the defensive team</li>
            <li>If a player has reached a pitch count of 41 or more, they cannot catch for the remainder of the game</li>
            <li>Managing player workload and safety is essential</li>

    <!-- Hitting Section -->
    <section id="hitting">
        <h2 id="hitting" class="left">Hitting</h2>
        <h4 id="balls-and-strikes" class="left">Balls and Strikes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>We play with a 4/3 count. This means that the batter starts with a count of 4 balls and 3 strikes.</li>
            <li>Three strikes result in an out. Even if a swinging or called strike is dropped by the catcher, it still counts as an out.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="outs" class="left">Outs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 3 outs in the field or strikeouts. After 3 outs, the teams switch sides.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="foul-tips" class="left">Foul Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Foul tips not caught by the catcher do not count as a third strike. The player “stays alive” and continues their at-bat.</li>
            <li>However, if a foul tip is caught by the catcher, it counts as a third strike</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="batting-order" class="left">Batting Order</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All teams follow a straight batting lineup, regardless of whether players are currently in the field or not</li>
            <li>There are no substitutions or pinch hitting allowed during the game</li>
            <li>If a player is injured and cannot bat, they are scratched from the lineup</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="number-of-at-bats" class="left">Number of At-Bats</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Coaches should aim to give each player at least two at-bats</li>
            <li>Understandably, achieving this goal can be challenging in low-scoring or short games</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="late-arrivals" class="left">Late Arrivals</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If a player arrives late to a game, they are inserted at the end of the batting lineup, regardless of the team’s current position in the lineup</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="throwing-of-bats" class="left">Throwing of Bats</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If a player throws the bat following an at-bat, they receive one warning</li>
            <li>If the player throws the bat again after the warning, they are removed from the game for safety precautions</li>
            <li>The umpire has discretion in issuing the warning and enforcing removal</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Base Running Section -->
    <section id="base-running">
        <h2 id="base-running" class="left">Base Running</h2>
        <h4 id="single-or-more" class="left">Single or More</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In AAA, base running skills are crucial. Unlike younger leagues, not every hit is automatically a single.</li>
            <li>Players who hit a legitimate double should take two bases, and three bases on a triple</li>
            <li>The main point to teach is to get out of the batter’s box quickly and look to your base coach for instructions</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="base-coaches" class="left">Base Coaches</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Having both a 1st and 3rd base coach is essential</li>
            <li>If you don’t have enough coaches to fill these roles, consider involving parents from the stands. It’s an excellent job for them.</li>
            <li>If these parent coaches haven’t participated in practices, you’ll need to teach them hand signals and how to instruct the players effectively</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="stealing--leading-off" class="left">Stealing / Leading Off</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stealing is allowed in the AAA Division</li>
            <li>However, there is no leading off. Base runners cannot leave the base until the ball has crossed home plate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="sliding" class="left">Sliding</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sliding is allowed in AAA and should be encouraged</li>
            <li>Note that head-first slides are not allowed for safety reasons</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Fielding Section -->
    <section id="fielding">
        <h2 id="fielding" class="left">Fielding</h2>
        <h4 id="number-of-players-in-the-field" class="left">Number of Players in the Field</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A standard 9-player lineup is used. This includes both infield and outfield positions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="infield-positions" class="left">Infield Positions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The infield consists of 6 players, following the normal baseball lineup</li>
            <li>These players cover positions such as pitcher, catcher, first base, second base, shortstop, and third base</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="outfield-positions" class="left">Outfield Positions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The outfield comprises 3 players</li>
            <li>They cover left field, center field, and right field</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="encroachment" class="left">Encroachment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>While there isn’t a specific rule regarding encroachment, it’s essential to avoid this type of play</li>
            <li>Even players who need more development still deserve opportunities to make plays</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="player-rotations" class="left">Player Rotations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All players must have at least one at-bat and play a minimum of 9 outs in the field during a six-inning game</li>
            <li>If the game is shortened (e.g., 4 or 5 innings), revert to a minimum of 6 outs in the field.</li>
            <li>Coaches should strive to get each player at least two at-bats, even in challenging situations like pitching duels</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <ul>
            <li>The league will provide a plate umpire during regular season games</li>
            <li>The plate umpire is responsible for calling balls, strikes, and other plate-related decisions</li>

        <h4 id="field-umpire-playoffs" class="left">Field Umpire (Playoffs)</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>If an umpire is not available at game time, the home team takes responsibility</li>
            <li>A guest umpire (usually a parent or volunteer) may step in. If they lack protective gear, they’ll call the game from behind the pitching rubber.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="second-field-umpire-visiting-team" class="left">Second Field Umpire (Visiting Team)</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>During a game, keep bats under your control</li>
            <li>Note that there is no warm-up circle in Little League, so your on-deck batter needs to be in the dugout</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="bench-players’-roles" class="left">Bench Players’ Roles</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bench players should organize the dugout during warm-ups</li>

            <li>Bats should ideally be between 27-31 inches in length and weigh between 15-20 ounces (as a general guideline)</li>
            <li>To check bat size, have the batter hold the bat with their left hand (if they’re a right-handed batter) and move it slowly across their body on a level plane. The bat should not dip excessively.</li>
            <li>Be aware of players using oversized bats just because they look cool or are a particular color. While you may not convince them to switch, limit the use of such large bats to the owner.</li>

        <h4 id="helmets" class="left">Helmets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect helmets for cracks or missing pads</li>
            <li>Some players may have concerns about lice. If so, they can purchase their own helmet.</li>
            <li>Remember that the manager/coach has the final authority on safety-related matters, so any “player-owned” equipment must meet your satisfaction</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Your equipment bags should contain a complete set of catchers gear, including a catcher’s glove</li>
