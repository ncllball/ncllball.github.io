This is the 5-Tool Assessment. Everything that is logged at assessments goes into this and spits out a number from 1-5 for each kid. A few days before the draft you'll receive it populated with kids' names.

So this is the board for draft day. There are actually sorta two drafts within one: The top is for returning AAA kids and the bottom is for new to AAA kids. https://ncllball.github.io/images/draft/01.jpg

You'll finish drafting as a group for all the returning players and then start again on the bottom for new to AAA kids. If you have a kid in the division, you'll be told beforehand where they would go in the draft based on that number and that will be the round they are taken and you will be skipped. This part is exactly like keepers in fantasy football. I forget how many assistants you can come into the draft with, but I think it's one this year. It's the exact same process for that coaches kid.

You'll sit in a room and just keep going util everyone is picked. You can ask any questions you want about the players. Who knows this kid? What's his attitude like? Are his parents decent to deal with? Etc. ;

At the end, there is a period of time for you to 'trade' kids. This is not based on talent, but more social engineering or maybe sponsorships. If two kids are a 2.5 but kid A has no one on his team from his school and kid B is ion the same situation, you can trade them. Or maybe your kids best friend of all time is a 1 and you want him on your team, you can trade another 1 on your team for that kid.
