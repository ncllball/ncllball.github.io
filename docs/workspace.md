# Multi-root workspace for 8-menu navigation

To make day-to-day edits faster without moving any published files, open the multi-root workspace that mirrors your top navigation.

- File: ncllball-8nav.code-workspace (repo root)
- Open it: File > Open Workspace from File... and select this file

What you get

- Explorer shows roots aligned with your header: Register, Baseball, Softball, Programs, Resources, Get Involved, Support, About
- Temporary: 2026 Season (temp) for quick seasonal edits
- URLs and script paths remain unchanged (no file moves)

Tip: The Sponsors page still lives under Support ("Support/Sponsors")

Tweaks

- You can add/remove roots by editing folders[] in the workspace file
- Seasonal folders (e.g., "2026 Season/") can be added as temporary roots during busy periods

Notes

- This is editor-only structure; it does not affect the site or GitHub Pages
- The existing tasks continue to work from the repo root
